a01-096u-s02-00.png	 My background is a doctor of 68 , who
a01-096u-s02-01.png	has practised medicine for 43 years , chiefly
a01-096u-s02-02.png	as a panel doctor .
a01-096u-s03-00.png	 I am a lifelong
a01-096u-s03-01.png	Conservative .
a01-096u-s04-00.png	I am horrified and amazed
a01-096u-s04-01.png	by my party's proposal to prostitute the
a01-096u-s04-02.png	whole principle of the State service and
a01-096u-s04-03.png	to render that service a hardship to poor
a01-096u-s04-04.png	people .
a01-102-s00-00.png	 After a lifetime of helping others and
a01-102-s00-01.png	healing the sick , my considered
a01-102-s00-02.png	opinion is that anybody supporting
a01-102-s00-03.png	the increased charges is a wicked ,

a01-113-s02-00.png	Answering jeers that it was Labour which first put a

a01-113u-s02-05.png	strain of the Korean war .
a01-117-s00-00.png	In fact , the Tories made it worse now for the sick and
a01-117-s00-01.png	needy than Labour had to make it in 1950 .

a01-117-s01-01.png	as a percentage of social service expenditure ,
a01-117-s01-02.png	health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.

a01-117-s02-01.png	unsmiling Mr. Powell .
a01-117-s03-00.png	He demanded that instead
a01-117-s03-01.png	of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should
a01-117-s03-02.png	take ruthless action against the drug making
a01-117-s03-03.png	industry , whose profits had risen by up to 400

a02-000-s00-00.png	MR. Macmillan has picked a strong brains trust 
a02-000-s00-01.png	team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market .
a02-000-s01-00.png	And he has abandoned plans to visit President de

a02-000-s02-04.png	but no more than that .
a02-004-s00-00.png	So the idea of personal mission by
a02-004-s00-01.png	the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped
a02-004-s01-00.png	Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a
a02-004-s01-01.png	hand-picked team under the leadership of

a02-020-s01-00.png	MR. Selwyn Lloyd -
a02-020-s01-01.png	a man with troubles enough back home - seems
a02-020-s01-02.png	fated to fly into trouble abroad .
a02-020-s02-00.png	Last year it was
a02-020-s02-01.png	the riots in Istanbul , which enlivened the NATO
a02-020-s02-02.png	Council meeting .
a02-024-s00-00.png	Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
a02-024-s00-01.png	Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com-
a02-024-s00-02.png	monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
a02-024-s00-03.png	first to be held in Africa .
a02-024-s01-00.png	Only a few hours af-
a02-024-s01-01.png	ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
a02-024-s01-02.png	at Accra this morning , hundreds of shop assistants
a02-024-s01-03.png	demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
a02-024-s01-04.png	Stores , the largest in town .
a02-027-s00-00.png	The stores had been hit by the same strike wave
a02-027-s00-01.png	that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past
a02-027-s00-02.png	week .
a02-027-s01-00.png	Root of the discontent : The austerity Budget ,
a02-027-s01-01.png	including a compulsory savings scheme which the
a02-027-s01-02.png	Ghana Government introduced in July .
a02-027-s02-00.png	Ghana's strong
a02-027-s02-01.png	man is not here to face the storm .
a02-027-s03-00.png	President Nkrumah ,
a02-027-s03-01.png	having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference
a02-027-s03-02.png	in Belgrade , has resumed his holiday on the Black
a02-027-s03-03.png	Sea and no one here professes to know when he
a02-027-s03-04.png	will return .
a02-032-s00-00.png	But in his absence his chief lieutenants have
a02-032-s00-01.png	not let him down .
a02-032-s01-00.png	The strong arm of authority has
a02-032-s01-01.png	been raised against the strikers and is now beginning
a02-032-s01-02.png	to tell .
a02-032-s02-00.png	Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto : The welfare
a02-032-s02-01.png	of the people is the supreme law ) reports :
a02-032-s03-00.png	 The
a02-032-s03-01.png	Government has been urged to take immediate ac-
a02-032-s03-02.png	tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers . 
a02-037-s00-00.png	The urge came from a conference of activists of
a02-037-s00-01.png	Nkrumah's Convention Party after powerful addresses
a02-037-s00-02.png	by Comrades Krobo Edusei , Tawia Adamafio , and
a02-037-s00-03.png	others .
a02-037-s01-00.png	Strong deeds followed strong words .
a02-037-s02-00.png	In Takoradi
a02-037-s02-01.png	a limited state of emergency was declared , giving
a02-037-s02-02.png	the Government adequate power to maintain all
a02-037-s02-03.png	essential services and ensure food supplies .
a02-037-s03-00.png	Thus it
a02-037-s03-01.png	becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
a02-037-s03-02.png	for anyone who publishes a report likely to cause
a02-037-s03-03.png	alarm or prejudicial to public safety . 
a02-042-s00-00.png	And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed
a02-042-s00-01.png	on anyone convicted of sabotage .
a02-042-s01-00.png	These stern measures
a02-042-s01-01.png	had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
a02-042-s01-02.png	strikers gave in , but in Takoradi , the chief storm centre ,
a02-042-s01-03.png	they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400
a02-042-s01-04.png	police and 16 armoured cars .
a02-042-s02-00.png	And how did the
a02-042-s02-01.png	Government react when the strikers demonstrated in
a02-042-s02-02.png	Accra ?
a02-046-s00-00.png	At 9.40 Mr. Edusei , Minister of Transport and pro-
a02-046-s00-01.png	bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team ,
a02-046-s00-02.png	drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the
a02-046-s00-03.png	demonstrators , most of them shopgirls in overalls .
a02-046-s01-00.png	 If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock , he
a02-046-s01-01.png	told them , ' the police will act . '
a02-046-s02-00.png	At five to ten
a02-046-s02-01.png	a posse of police arrived and in less than
a02-046-s02-02.png	two minutes the crowd had gone .
a02-050-s00-00.png	If the threatened counter-revolution was not * to bring
a02-050-s00-01.png	the President back from his travels it might have been
a02-050-s00-02.png	thought that the muster from the 13 States of the
a02-050-s00-03.png	Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence .
a02-050-s01-00.png	After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this
a02-050-s01-01.png	year the Economic Consultative Council should meet
a02-050-s01-02.png	in Accra .
a02-050-s01-03.png	* enough
a02-053-s00-00.png	It has been left , however , to Mr. Goka , Ghana's Finance
a02-053-s00-01.png	Minister , to do the honours as host , in which capacity
a02-053-s00-02.png	he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador
a02-053-s00-03.png	Hotel .
a02-053-s01-00.png	POLICE , on direct orders from the Cabinet , are
a02-053-s01-01.png	openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-
a02-053-s01-02.png	disarming Committee of 100 , the Committee claimed
a02-053-s01-03.png	yesterday .
a02-053-s02-00.png	It said pressure was being put on
a02-053-s02-01.png	members and associates all over the country .
a02-057-s00-00.png	It alleged :
a02-057-s01-00.png	Phones were being tapped and
a02-057-s01-01.png	going out of action ;
a02-057-s02-00.png	Police were visiting
a02-057-s02-01.png	people on no pretext whatsoever , except
a02-057-s02-02.png	to pass the time of day ;
a02-057-s03-00.png	Supporters had
a02-057-s03-01.png	been warned - one that his connection
a02-057-s03-02.png	with the committee was going too far ; another
a02-057-s03-03.png	that anti-apartheid agitation was
a02-057-s03-04.png	all right , but support for the committee
a02-057-s03-05.png	was not .
a02-062-s00-00.png	A third man's house was watched for four days
a02-062-s00-01.png	by plain-clothes men .
a02-062-s01-00.png	Committee-member Mr. George
a02-062-s01-01.png	Clark commented at a Press conference :
a02-062-s02-00.png	 The
a02-062-s02-01.png	most extraordinary things are happening . 
a02-062-s03-00.png	Fifty
a02-062-s03-01.png	committee members will appear at Bow-street
a02-062-s03-02.png	today , including Lord Russell , Lady Russell ,
a02-062-s03-03.png	Lord Boyd-Orr , the Rev. Michael Scott , and
a02-062-s03-04.png	Mr. Clark .
a02-067-s00-00.png	They are required to show why they
a02-067-s00-01.png	should not be bound over for disturbing
a02-067-s00-02.png	the peace and for inciting a breach
a02-067-s00-03.png	of the peace .
a02-067-s01-00.png	The summonses say they
a02-067-s01-01.png	are likely to persevere in such unlawful
a02-067-s01-02.png	conduct . 
a02-067-s02-00.png	Lord Russell , 89 , was
a02-067-s02-01.png	putting his affairs in order , and
a02-067-s02-02.png	packing a case , at his Chelsea home
a02-067-s02-03.png	yesterday .
a02-067-s03-00.png	His secretary , American-born
a02-067-s03-01.png	Mr. Ralph Schoenman , said :
a02-072-s00-00.png	 He is not going to agree to be bound over .
a02-072-s01-00.png	That will
a02-072-s01-01.png	probably mean jail and , though frail , he is very fit and
a02-072-s01-02.png	will take the rigours of prison in his stride .
a02-072-s02-00.png	He
a02-072-s02-01.png	hopes to be allowed to do some writing . 
a02-072-s03-00.png	Back at
a02-072-s03-01.png	the Press conference , Mr. Clark said two committee
a02-072-s03-02.png	members tried a plant call on suspect phone .
a02-072-s04-00.png	They
a02-072-s04-01.png	discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none
a02-072-s04-02.png	was planned but police turned up .
a02-078-s00-00.png	Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no
a02-078-s00-01.png	longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth
a02-078-s00-02.png	Kaunda .
a02-078-s01-00.png	Sir Roy , Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister ,
a02-078-s01-01.png	said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence
a02-078-s01-02.png	Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia
a02-078-s01-03.png	National Congress , which was led by Mr. Kaunda
a02-078-s01-04.png	until he was outlawed in 1959 .
a02-078-s02-00.png	The record
a02-078-s02-01.png	of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went
a02-078-s02-02.png	back a long way , Sir Roy told the
a02-078-s02-03.png	Federal Parliament in Salisbury .
a02-082-s00-00.png	He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters
a02-082-s00-01.png	had been arrested or convicted since last year on
a02-082-s00-02.png	charges of creating disturbances .
a02-082-s01-00.png	During the first
a02-082-s01-01.png	three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents
a02-082-s01-02.png	had been reported in Northern Rhodesia .
a02-082-s02-00.png	More
a02-082-s02-01.png	than 500 people - 167 of them members of
a02-082-s02-02.png	the UNIP - were convicted last month in the
a02-082-s02-03.png	Northern Province alone .
a02-086-s00-00.png	 Against this background must be taken Mr.
a02-086-s00-01.png	Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is
a02-086-s00-02.png	doing is in the name of non-violence , said
a02-086-s00-03.png	Sir Roy .
a02-086-s01-00.png	 I am now compelled to say that
a02-086-s01-01.png	I don't accept his good faith . 
a02-086-s02-00.png	He said
a02-086-s02-01.png	Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements
a02-086-s02-02.png	had stimulated violence , but he had done
a02-086-s02-03.png	nothing to stop it .
a02-090-s00-00.png	 It is true he made a point of again being absent
a02-090-s00-01.png	from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have
a02-090-s00-02.png	indulged in such violence . 
a02-090-s01-00.png	But Sir Roy pointed out
a02-090-s01-01.png	that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that
a02-090-s01-02.png	if UNIP did not get its way what would happen
a02-090-s01-03.png	would make the Mau Mau in Kenya seem like a
a02-090-s01-04.png	child's picnic . 
a02-093-s00-00.png	JOHN DICKIE writes :
a02-093-s01-00.png	Mr. Macmillan gave top
a02-093-s01-01.png	priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his
a02-093-s01-02.png	return from Scotland yesterday .
a02-093-s02-00.png	He summoned Mr.
a02-093-s02-01.png	Iain Macleod , Colonial Secretary , and Mr. Duncan Sandys ,
a02-093-s02-02.png	Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks
a02-093-s02-03.png	at Admiralty House .
a02-093-s03-00.png	A statement is expected today
a02-093-s03-01.png	to hold the door open for modifications to the
a02-093-s03-02.png	new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
a02-093-s03-03.png	in Northern Rhodesia .
a02-098-s00-00.png	Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting
a02-098-s00-01.png	problem .
a02-098-s01-00.png	Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a
a02-098-s01-01.png	strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any
a02-098-s01-02.png	suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the
a02-098-s01-03.png	African nationalists .
a02-098-s02-00.png	Mr. Macleod has ample evidence
a02-098-s02-01.png	from talks with Sir John Moffat , Northern Rhodesian
a02-098-s02-02.png	Liberal leader , and Mr. Kaunda , that the bulk
a02-098-s02-03.png	of moderates and Africans will reject the
a02-098-s02-04.png	Constitution unless it is modified .
a02-102-s00-00.png	A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of
a02-102-s00-01.png	Buganda ( King Freddie ) from Princess
a02-102-s00-02.png	Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro , kneeling at the
a02-102-s00-03.png	foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport
a02-102-s00-04.png	yesterday .
a02-102-s01-00.png	Forty other Africans greeted him ,
a02-102-s01-01.png	kneeling with heads bowed .
a02-102-s02-00.png	The princess ,
a02-102-s02-01.png	aged 24 , is now studying history at Cambri-
a02-102-s02-02.png	dge , where she is a friend of Prince William
a02-102-s02-03.png	of Gloucester .
a02-106-s00-00.png	King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of
a02-106-s00-01.png	native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with
a02-106-s00-02.png	Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod , before the
a02-106-s00-03.png	Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday .
a02-106-s01-00.png	The question : Their status in an independent Uganda .
a02-106-s02-00.png	The thorniest problem for next week's conference is
a02-106-s02-01.png	to settle the relationships between them and the
a02-106-s02-02.png	rest of the country .
a02-106-s03-00.png	A Government report has
a02-106-s03-01.png	recognised their rights and recommended a form of
a02-106-s03-02.png	federal association , but the four kings are not
a02-111-s00-00.png	Instead , the kings will remain in London
a02-111-s00-01.png	and wait to hear the conference's proposals .
a02-111-s01-00.png	Then their views will be transmitted back .
a02-111-s02-00.png	MR. BUTLER , the Home Secretary , has decided
a02-111-s02-01.png	to meet head-on the biggest challenge to
a02-111-s02-02.png	Government authority yet presented by the
a02-111-s02-03.png	 Ban-the-Bomb demonstrators .
a02-111-s03-00.png	Police leave
a02-111-s03-01.png	has been cancelled and secret plans prepared
a02-111-s03-02.png	to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned
a02-111-s03-03.png	for Sunday in Parliament-square by the
a02-111-s03-04.png	Committee of 100 , the anti-nuclear arms
a02-111-s03-05.png	group .
a02-116-s00-00.png	It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which
a02-116-s00-01.png	ended yesterday in 32 members of the
a02-116-s00-02.png	Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
a02-116-s00-03.png	a breach of the peace .
a02-116-s01-00.png	The committee's
a02-116-s01-01.png	president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
a02-116-s01-02.png	his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
a02-116-s01-03.png	a week .
a02-116-s02-00.png	Playwrights Arnold Wesker ( The Kitchen )
a02-116-s02-01.png	and Robert Bolt ( The Flowering Cherry ) were
a02-116-s02-02.png	jailed for a month .
a02-120-s00-00.png	The possibility that the Government might
a02-120-s00-01.png	invoke the Public Order Act , 1936 , and
a02-120-s00-02.png	declare the whole rally illegal - whether
a02-120-s00-03.png	the demonstrators sit down or not - was
a02-120-s00-04.png	being discussed in Whitehall last night .
a02-120-s01-00.png	It was last used a year ago , to deal
a02-120-s01-01.png	with the St. Pancras rent riots .
a02-120-s02-00.png	Today
a02-120-s02-01.png	Mr. Butler will have talks with Police
a02-120-s02-02.png	Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to
a02-120-s02-03.png	draw up final plans for the Battle
a02-120-s02-04.png	of Parliament Square . 
a02-124-s00-00.png	Measures agreed so far include : 1 . A mass
a02-124-s00-01.png	call-out of police , special constables
a02-124-s00-02.png	and reserves , with 750 policemen posted
a02-124-s00-03.png	from outlying districts to stations in
a02-124-s00-04.png	the area - West End Central , Bow-street ,
a02-124-s00-05.png	and Cannon-row .
a03-006-s00-00.png	Today , for example , the Foreign Minister of Indo-
a03-006-s00-01.png	nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav
a03-006-s00-02.png	Foreign Minister .
a03-006-s01-00.png	In fact such Yugoslav activity has
a03-006-s01-01.png	been # particularly intensified in the past year
a03-006-s01-02.png	or so and though so far , apart from joint action
a03-006-s01-03.png	in the United Nations , these exchanges have not
a03-006-s01-04.png	been seen on any wider basis , President Tito
a03-006-s01-05.png	is known for some time to have favoured a
a03-006-s01-06.png	conference of neutralist leaders .
a03-009-s00-00.png	The wish was particularly apparent in comments
a03-009-s00-01.png	on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and ,
a03-009-s00-02.png	in particular , in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an
a03-009-s00-03.png	inter-African consultative assembly which would
a03-009-s00-04.png	coordinate activity on the political and economic
a03-009-s00-05.png	sphere ; and it is not difficult to see that President
a03-009-s00-06.png	Tito would like some such idea extended also
a03-009-s00-07.png	to the whole uncommitted world
a03-011-s00-00.png	But he now feels , in view of a changed international
a03-011-s00-01.png	situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing
a03-011-s00-02.png	the new and independent countries of Africa , that the
a03-011-s00-03.png	time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between
a03-011-s00-04.png	the uncommitted countries and even to work out common
a03-011-s00-05.png	stands on various problems facing those nations .
a03-011-s01-00.png	Two
a03-011-s01-01.png	subjects , the Congo and Algeria , are the main topics
a03-011-s01-02.png	of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two
a03-011-s01-03.png	leaders have identical ideas .
a03-014-s00-00.png	Two emissaries from the Laotian Government
a03-014-s00-01.png	of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in
a03-014-s00-02.png	Phnom Penh , Cambodia , to invite Prince
a03-014-s00-03.png	Souvanna Phouma , the former Prime Min-
a03-014-s00-04.png	ister , to return to Laos .
a03-014-s01-00.png	No details of
a03-014-s01-01.png	their mission have been disclosed , but it
a03-014-s01-02.png	was reported earlier in Laos that Prince
a03-014-s01-03.png	Boun Oum was considering asking
a03-014-s01-04.png	Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his
a03-014-s01-05.png	Government .
a03-017-s00-00.png	Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to
a03-017-s00-01.png	the mission , but recent statements made by him
a03-017-s00-02.png	in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
a03-017-s00-03.png	himself as the only legal Prime Minister of
a03-017-s00-04.png	Laos .
a03-017-s01-00.png	His policy of strict neutrality from 1951
a03-017-s01-01.png	to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though
a03-017-s01-02.png	at the cost of virtual partition of the country
a03-017-s01-03.png	into the pro-communist north and the
a03-017-s01-04.png	pro-western centre and south .
a03-020-s00-00.png	Prince Souvanna's former Minister of
a03-020-s00-01.png	Information , Mr. Quinim Pholsena , who
a03-020-s00-02.png	claims to be his representative in
a03-020-s00-03.png	Laos , yesterday addressed all officers
a03-020-s00-04.png	of the pro-communist forces
a03-020-s00-05.png	occupying the province of Xieng
a03-020-s00-06.png	Khouang and emphasized that
a03-020-s00-07.png	Prince
a03-020-s01-00.png	Souphannouvong , leader
a03-020-s01-01.png	of the pro-communist Neo Lao
a03-020-s01-02.png	Haksat Party , also to the officers
a03-020-s01-03.png	in the same terms .
a03-023-s00-00.png	This emphasis on the legality of the former
a03-023-s00-01.png	Government suggests that all is not well
a03-023-s00-02.png	with the political and military leadership
a03-023-s00-03.png	of the pro-communists .
a03-023-s01-00.png	Most of the
a03-023-s01-01.png	province of Xieng Khouang and the
a03-023-s01-02.png	tactically useful Plain of Jars , however ,
a03-023-s01-03.png	appear still to be firmly in their hands .
a03-023-s02-00.png	The Government has claimed the
a03-023-s02-01.png	recapture of Vang Vieng , the pro-
a03-023-s02-02.png	communists' former base 60 miles
a03-023-s02-03.png	north of Vientiane , but this claim
a03-027-s00-00.png	A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within
a03-027-s00-01.png	a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that
a03-027-s00-02.png	this village was still held by the pro-communists .
a03-027-s01-00.png	With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica
a03-027-s01-01.png	and # his Cabinet out in the grass roots making
a03-027-s01-02.png	160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days , the Liberal
a03-027-s01-03.png	Party are holding a national conference here with
a03-027-s01-04.png	some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958
a03-027-s01-05.png	when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party
a03-027-s01-06.png	leader .
a03-030-s00-00.png	In some ways it will be a testing occasion
a03-030-s00-01.png	for him , although some think his position
a03-030-s00-02.png	unassailable simply because there is no one
a03-030-s00-03.png	else in sight to supplant him .
a03-030-s01-00.png	So the con-
a03-030-s01-01.png	ference will concentrate on laying the
a03-030-s01-02.png	foundations on which to win the next
a03-030-s01-03.png	election .
a03-030-s02-00.png	The rally comes at a time
a03-030-s02-01.png	when in spite of carefully worded state-
a03-030-s02-02.png	ments by the Prime Minister there is an
a03-030-s02-03.png	air of electoral expectancy .
a03-034-s00-00.png	Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
a03-034-s00-01.png	a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
a03-034-s00-02.png	which outlines in some detail the accomplishments
a03-034-s00-03.png	of the party since it came to office three and
a03-034-s00-04.png	a half years ago .
a03-034-s01-00.png	Nevertheless there is little
a03-034-s01-01.png	illusion in the Conservative Party that their
a03-034-s01-02.png	stock at home has fallen in the face of
a03-034-s01-03.png	heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy .
a03-037-s00-00.png	Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
a03-037-s00-01.png	provincial governments , Quebec and New Brunswick , and
a03-037-s00-02.png	in the four federal by-elections last October the party
a03-037-s00-03.png	fared badly .
a03-037-s01-00.png	They are now faced with four other by-
a03-037-s01-01.png	elections , one at Esquimalt Saanich , British Columbia ,
a03-037-s01-02.png	one in Leeds , Ontario , and the other two in the
a03-037-s01-03.png	Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska , New Brunswick ,
a03-037-s01-04.png	and Kings , Prince Edward Island .
a03-040-s00-00.png	All four were Conservative strongholds .
a03-040-s01-00.png	Last September
a03-040-s01-01.png	a public poll showed that for the first time since
a03-040-s01-02.png	the Administration came to power in 1957 the
a03-040-s01-03.png	Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour
a03-040-s01-04.png	of The Grits if a federal election had been
a03-040-s01-05.png	held last autumn , 38 per cent for the
a03-040-s01-06.png	Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F. ) .
a03-043-s00-00.png	However , a separate poll revealed that Mr.
a03-043-s00-01.png	Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
a03-043-s00-02.png	popularity as an individual leader ( for
a03-043-s00-03.png	Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent , for Mr.
a03-043-s00-04.png	Pearson 34 per cent ) .
a03-043-s01-00.png	How far is Mr.
a03-043-s01-01.png	Lester Pearson acceptable to the people
a03-043-s01-02.png	of Canada as a Prime Minister ?
a03-043-s02-00.png	Many
a03-043-s02-01.png	observers at the national rally will be
a03-043-s02-02.png	seeking an answer .
a03-047-s00-00.png	It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
a03-047-s00-01.png	in the role of a popular orator at the
a03-047-s00-02.png	hustings , the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
a03-047-s00-03.png	baker was in the last two campaigns .
a03-047-s01-00.png	The
a03-047-s01-01.png	impression remains that the Liberal leader
a03-047-s01-02.png	is still the diplomatist , more at home
a03-047-s01-03.png	in the chancery , or the corridors of the United
a03-047-s01-04.png	Nations , not the father figure , so necessary
a03-047-s01-05.png	in Canadian leadership , or the practical
a03-047-s01-06.png	politician , able to talk about sewage problems
a03-047-s01-07.png	in Algoma East .
a03-050-s00-00.png	On the other hand , Mr. Pearson excels
a03-050-s00-01.png	in meeting people informally , but many
a03-050-s00-02.png	still regard him as some sort of cross
a03-050-s00-03.png	between an egghead and a missionary .
a03-050-s01-00.png	His party advisers are now trying to
a03-050-s01-01.png	correct that image .

a03-054-s02-02.png	days .
a03-054-s03-00.png	It has been a hard road back
a03-054-s03-01.png	but now , with plenty of political
a03-054-s03-02.png	ammunition given him by the Gov-
a03-054-s03-03.png	ernment in recent sessions , he is
a03-054-s03-04.png	leading the Opposition with skill and
a03-054-s03-05.png	assurance and is a match for the

a03-059-s01-00.png	Mr. Pearson is now talking about his
a03-059-s01-01.png	new and dynamic liberalism and this
a03-059-s01-02.png	week will # show perhaps how far Mike
a03-059-s01-03.png	will go .
a03-059-s02-00.png	The main topic under review is

a03-063-s00-00.png	Sentence Database
a03-063-s01-00.png	Mr. Thorneycroft , the Minister of Aviation , who arrives in
a03-063-s01-01.png	Bonn tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a
a03-063-s01-02.png	European space satellite project , will find the Germans
a03-063-s01-03.png	interested in the principle of space research , but rather
a03-063-s01-04.png	sceptical about British plans for organizing it .
a03-063-s02-00.png	Stated more bluntly , they are still unconvinced that
a03-063-s02-01.png	this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to
a03-063-s02-02.png	salve Blue Streak , which was abandoned last summer
a03-063-s02-03.png	as a military project ; or that the European space satellite
a03-063-s02-04.png	is indeed to be purely scientific in character .
a03-066-s00-00.png	Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
a03-066-s00-01.png	remove these doubts , and to persuade the
a03-066-s00-02.png	Federal Government that the financial burden
a03-066-s00-03.png	involved is really worth while , at a time when
a03-066-s00-04.png	any increase in budgetary commitments
a03-066-s00-05.png	would almost certainly involve a corresponding
a03-066-s00-06.png	rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
a03-066-s00-07.png	to contemplate in an election year .
a03-071-s00-00.png	But , at the same time , there is reason to
a03-071-s00-01.png	believe that the Federal Government is not
a03-071-s00-02.png	convinced , on the basis of the information
a03-071-s00-03.png	it has so far , that such a project would
a03-071-s00-04.png	be justified from a scientific point of view ;
a03-071-s00-05.png	and not merely constitute a prestige 
a03-071-s00-06.png	satellite , duplicating to some extent American
a03-071-s00-07.png	efforts , as Die Welt suggests today in
a03-071-s00-08.png	a highly critical editorial article .
a03-073-s00-00.png	On the specific question of the use of Blue
a03-073-s00-01.png	Streak , Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be
a03-073-s00-02.png	easier .
a03-073-s01-00.png	He can point out that this is the
a03-073-s01-01.png	only rocket and launcher in Europe to
a03-073-s01-02.png	have reached a sufficient stage of development
a03-073-s01-03.png	for adaptation as the first stage in
a03-073-s01-04.png	putting a heavy satellite into outer space .
a03-073-s02-00.png	There has also been some talk of adopting another
a03-073-s02-01.png	British rocket , Black Knight , for the second
a03-073-s02-02.png	stage , but the French have one of their
a03-073-s02-03.png	own called Veronique which they would
a03-073-s02-04.png	like to see used .
a03-080-s00-00.png	The Foreign Ministry spokesman added
a03-080-s00-01.png	today , however , that the Brussels Treaty
a03-080-s00-02.png	was irrelevant , because research on the
a03-080-s00-03.png	various rocket stages had already been
a03-080-s00-04.png	concluded , and only cooperation on the type
a03-080-s00-05.png	of capsule was involved .
a03-080-s01-00.png	A lesser obstacle
a03-080-s01-01.png	to German participation is the absence of
a03-080-s01-02.png	any Ministry or Minister directly responsible
a03-080-s01-03.png	for it - and therefore of any budget
a03-080-s01-04.png	under which funds could be appropriated .
a03-089-s00-00.png	This is expected eventually to replace the
a03-089-s00-01.png	Fiat G-91 , and the F 104 Starfighter ,
a03-089-s00-02.png	the backbone of the German Air

a04-000-s00-00.png	PRESIDENT KENNEDY renewed his pressure
a04-000-s00-01.png	on Mr. Harold Macmillan to join the
a04-000-s00-02.png	Common Market during their talks at Admiralty
a04-000-s00-03.png	House , Whitehall , yesterday .
a04-000-s01-00.png	Much of their
a04-000-s01-01.png	three hours , 20 minutes of discussion is believed
a04-000-s01-02.png	to have been devoted to this main point
a04-000-s01-03.png	of American policy .
a04-003-s00-00.png	It arose during talks following
a04-003-s00-01.png	President Kennedy's report to the British
a04-003-s00-02.png	Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent
a04-003-s00-03.png	visit to Paris .
a04-003-s01-00.png	There General de Gaulle had made
a04-003-s01-01.png	clear that he would accept Britain into the
a04-003-s01-02.png	Common Market only if there were no conditions
a04-003-s01-03.png	laid down to meet the Commonwealth
a04-003-s01-04.png	and other reservations .
a04-006-s00-00.png	Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still
a04-006-s00-01.png	wanted him to apply for membership of the Common
a04-006-s00-02.png	Market , even if it meant an unconditional surrender .
a04-006-s01-00.png	There were also brief discussions on Laos , Berlin
a04-006-s01-01.png	and other foreign questions , after Mr. Kennedy had
a04-006-s01-02.png	informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr.
a04-006-s01-03.png	Krushchov .
a04-006-s02-00.png	With the exception of 40 minutes when
a04-006-s02-01.png	Lord Home , Foreign Secretary , and Mr. McGeorge
a04-006-s02-02.png	Bundy , the President's special assistant for
a04-006-s02-03.png	security affairs , were brought in , the two
a04-006-s02-04.png	men talked alone .
a04-010-s00-00.png	An attempt to get more information about the
a04-010-s00-01.png	Admiralty House meeting will be made in the
a04-010-s00-02.png	House of Commons this afternoon .
a04-010-s01-00.png	Labour M.P.s already

a04-010-s03-01.png	broadcast and television report on his
a04-010-s03-02.png	talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening .
a04-015-s00-00.png	The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's
a04-015-s00-01.png	third talks - the first were at Key West , Florida , the second in
a04-015-s00-02.png	Washington - said :
a04-015-s01-00.png	 Their discussions covered the major problems ,
a04-015-s01-01.png	both economic and political , and revealed once again the
a04-015-s01-02.png	close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their
a04-015-s01-03.png	common purposes .
a04-015-s02-00.png	 Occasion was given to review the need for
a04-015-s02-01.png	economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests
a04-015-s02-02.png	of developed and underdeveloped countries alike . 
a04-019-s00-00.png	It said that the President and Premier noted with satisfaction the
a04-019-s00-01.png	agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire ,
a04-019-s00-02.png	which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement at the
a04-019-s00-03.png	Geneva conference .
a04-019-s01-00.png	 Particular attention was also given to the
a04-019-s01-01.png	nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament .
a04-019-s02-00.png	 The
a04-019-s02-01.png	situation in regard to Germany was reviewed , and there was full
a04-019-s02-02.png	agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and
a04-019-s02-03.png	obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin . 
a04-023-s00-00.png	Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks , followed by lunch
a04-023-s00-01.png	given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other
a04-023-s00-02.png	guests present , Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more
a04-023-s00-03.png	times yesterday .
a04-023-s01-00.png	In PARIS , Mr. Dean Rusk , U.S. Secretary of
a04-023-s01-01.png	State , gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the
a04-023-s01-02.png	15-nation Nato council .
a04-023-s02-00.png	Some of his listeners said he was
a04-023-s02-01.png	 rather pessimistic and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year .
a04-027-s00-00.png	From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle
a04-027-s00-01.png	and informed him of the Vienna outcome .
a04-027-s01-00.png	Last night Mr. Rusk arrived
a04-027-s01-01.png	in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
a04-027-s01-02.png	fly home with the President .
a04-027-s02-00.png	In DUESSELDORF , Chancellor Adenauer
a04-027-s02-01.png	said the Vienna talks might be the beginning of a slight improvement , 
a04-027-s02-02.png	but no big changes should be expected in the political situation .
a04-031-s00-00.png	RELAXED , smiling and clearly in the best of
a04-031-s00-01.png	spirits , Mr. Krushchov yesterday returned to
a04-031-s00-02.png	Moscow after his two days of talks with President
a04-031-s00-03.png	Kennedy , writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow .
a04-031-s01-00.png	The
a04-031-s01-01.png	good beginning made at Vienna must be
a04-031-s01-02.png	followed up by new efforts for peace , the
a04-031-s01-03.png	Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
a04-031-s01-04.png	declared yesterday .
a04-031-s02-00.png	Events in Vienna gave hope
a04-031-s02-01.png	to people of goodwill who hate the cold war ,
a04-031-s02-02.png	and to all who are striving for a stable peace , 
a04-035-s00-00.png	 Thinking over the results of the Vienna
a04-035-s00-01.png	meeting , peace-loving people will say ' a
a04-035-s00-02.png	good beginning . ' 
a04-035-s01-00.png	Mr. Krushchov remained at the
a04-035-s01-01.png	airport to join President Brezhnev in welcoming
a04-035-s01-02.png	Dr. Sukarno , President and Prime Minister of
a04-035-s01-03.png	Indonesia , who arrived by Boeing 707 jet on a
a04-035-s01-04.png	state visit 40 minutes after Mr. Khrushchov had
a04-035-s01-05.png	arrived from Vienna .
a04-035-s02-00.png	A cheering , delighted crowd
a04-035-s02-01.png	of Indonesian students broke through crash barriers

a04-039-s00-01.png	Mr. Khrushchov said he hoped his weekend
a04-039-s00-02.png	talks with President Kennedy would # help to
a04-039-s00-03.png	establish an enduring peace between nations . 
a04-039-s01-00.png	Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President
a04-039-s01-01.png	Schaerf , the Soviet Premier thanked Austria for
a04-039-s01-02.png	the hospitality and welcome he had received .
a04-039-s02-00.png	 The Soviet Union has always striven and is
a04-039-s02-01.png	striving to safeguard an enduring peace for
a04-039-s02-02.png	the peoples , to secure an early solution of the
a04-043-s00-00.png	MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded
a04-043-s00-01.png	defence of the Polaris missile base .
a04-043-s01-00.png	And by
a04-043-s01-01.png	implication he supported the establishment of
a04-043-s01-02.png	sites in Britain for the training of German
a04-043-s01-03.png	troops .
a04-043-s02-00.png	His main theme was that nuclear
a04-043-s02-01.png	weapons were necessary to defend Britain , that
a04-043-s02-02.png	Britain must depend on Nato and the West 
a04-043-s02-03.png	must have nuclear weapons so long as the
a04-043-s02-04.png	Soviet Union has them .
a04-047-s00-00.png	Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
a04-047-s00-01.png	of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt
a04-047-s00-02.png	sure the Labour movement was coming round in
a04-047-s00-03.png	support of his views .
a04-047-s01-00.png	Obviously conscious of the fierce and
a04-047-s01-01.png	widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
a04-047-s01-02.png	Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
a04-047-s01-03.png	supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
a04-047-s01-04.png	their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
a04-047-s01-05.png	to the missile .
a04-050-s00-00.png	Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
a04-050-s00-01.png	not deny facilities to nations to which it was
a04-050-s00-02.png	allied .
a04-050-s01-00.png	But governments should be free to negotiate
a04-050-s01-01.png	and refuse proposals with which they did not
a04-050-s01-02.png	agree .
a04-050-s02-00.png	The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles , because ,
a04-050-s02-01.png	he said , they were out of date and vulnerable and
a04-050-s02-02.png	would attract enemy action .
a04-054-s00-00.png	That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine .
a04-054-s01-00.png	So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons ,
a04-054-s01-01.png	the West , somewhere , must have them too .
a04-054-s02-00.png	It
a04-054-s02-01.png	was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
a04-054-s02-02.png	purposes to be under the sea rather than on land .
a04-054-s03-00.png	This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
a04-054-s03-01.png	to oppose the Polaris depot ship .
a04-059-s00-00.png	The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
a04-059-s00-01.png	in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a
a04-059-s00-02.png	city with two million people .
a04-059-s01-00.png	It should be sited
a04-059-s01-01.png	in a more remote area .
a04-059-s02-00.png	Mr. Gaitskell added that
a04-059-s02-01.png	the Scarborough conference decisions did not , in his
a04-059-s02-02.png	view , truly reflect the opinions of the majority
a04-059-s02-03.png	of party members and still less the party's
a04-059-s02-04.png	supporters in the country .
a04-066-s00-00.png	Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
a04-066-s00-01.png	unilateralists was not possible , though
a04-066-s00-02.png	he respected their views .
a04-066-s01-00.png	He saw by reports
a04-066-s01-01.png	that those who organise these things were
a04-066-s01-02.png	recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
a04-066-s01-03.png	disarmament to shift the emphasis of
a04-066-s01-04.png	their intervention away from straight opposition
a04-066-s01-05.png	to the official document on to opposition
a04-066-s01-06.png	to the Polaris base .
a04-069-s00-00.png	To Mr. Macmillan , Mr Gaitskell said the
a04-069-s00-01.png	Prime Minister should begin to take
a04-069-s00-02.png	seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
a04-069-s00-03.png	weapons within the Nato alliance .
a04-069-s01-00.png	 Let us say
a04-069-s01-01.png	to Macmillan that he should press , I hope
a04-069-s01-02.png	with the agreement of Kennedy , in
a04-069-s01-03.png	talks with the Soviet Union , for the establishment
a04-069-s01-04.png	in central Europe of a zone of controlled
a04-069-s01-05.png	disarmament . 
a04-072-s00-00.png	He thought , he said , that the Soviet
a04-072-s00-01.png	Union would be prepared to reach
a04-072-s00-02.png	an agreement on a zone of controlled
a04-072-s00-03.png	disarmament in Europe .
a04-072-s01-00.png	Mr Gaitskell
a04-072-s01-01.png	concluded , declaring that the present
a04-072-s01-02.png	was the beginning of a great period of
a04-072-s01-03.png	opportunity for the party .
a04-072-s02-00.png	It was a
a04-072-s02-01.png	great chance that should be grasped .
a04-072-s03-00.png	Inter-union jealousies prevent the
a04-072-s03-01.png	fulfilment of a common policy for wages
a04-072-s03-02.png	and other major questions , Mr. Jack Cooper
a04-081-s00-00.png	The General Council of the Trades Union
a04-081-s00-01.png	Congress should therefore consider the
a04-081-s00-02.png	matter .
a04-081-s01-00.png	Consideration should also be given
a04-081-s01-01.png	to the regrouping of unions and the
a04-081-s01-02.png	modification of their structures to
a04-081-s01-03.png	meet the growing concentration of
a04-081-s01-04.png	capital .
a04-081-s02-00.png	Mr. Cooper argued that a
a04-081-s02-01.png	common industrial contribution was
a04-081-s02-02.png	urgent - particularly in unions serving
a04-081-s02-03.png	workers in the same industry - along
a04-085-s00-00.png	Suggesting that a total T.U.C.
a04-085-s00-01.png	membership of eight million was a poor
a04-085-s00-02.png	show compared with some countries , he
a04-085-s00-03.png	argued that the position needed examination .
a04-085-s01-00.png	BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.
a04-085-s01-01.png	Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
a04-085-s01-02.png	the views of a wide section of the
a04-085-s01-03.png	British people about Polaris submarine
a04-085-s01-04.png	bases in this country .
a04-085-s02-00.png	An open letter
a04-085-s02-01.png	written by Earl Russell hoping that the
a04-089-s00-00.png	Earl Russell , President of the Committee
a04-089-s00-01.png	of 100 , told Kennedy that he should
a04-089-s00-02.png	take notice of that very large and
a04-089-s00-03.png	growing section which is opposed to
a04-089-s00-04.png	the establishment of a Polaris base ,
a04-089-s00-05.png	whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
a04-089-s00-06.png	British territory . 
a04-089-s01-00.png	He pointed out that
a04-089-s01-01.png	already there have been protests but
a04-089-s01-02.png	that very much larger protests are to
a04-089-s01-03.png	be expected and are being planned . 
a04-092-s00-00.png	There are three kinds of reasons that justify
a04-092-s00-01.png	the protests and these should carry weight with
a04-092-s00-02.png	the U.S. Government , Earl Russell suggested .
a04-092-s01-00.png	 The
a04-092-s01-01.png	first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
a04-092-s01-02.png	serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
a04-092-s01-03.png	U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government
a04-092-s01-04.png	circles , but in public opinion . 
a04-092-s02-00.png	Earl Russell
a04-092-s02-01.png	says it is inevitable , though profoundly
a04-092-s02-02.png	regrettable , that the agitation against
a04-092-s02-03.png	the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
a04-092-s02-04.png	to the policy of the United States .
a04-096-s00-00.png	The second reason is concerned with doubts
a04-096-s00-01.png	as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ;
a04-096-s00-02.png	 in the time of crisis it would probably be
a04-096-s00-03.png	impossible for the British authorities to
a04-096-s00-04.png	exercise any degree of control over the action
a04-096-s00-05.png	of Polaris submarines . 
a04-096-s01-00.png	He argues that
a04-096-s01-01.png	there is a distinct possibility that so long
a04-096-s01-02.png	as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
a04-096-s01-03.png	Soviet Union might retaliate against
a04-096-s01-04.png	Britain alone .
a04-099-s00-00.png	 Such retaliation might , and probably would ,
a04-099-s00-01.png	destroy the whole population of Britain in
a04-099-s00-02.png	the course of , at the most , an hour without
a04-099-s00-03.png	provoking American retaliation .
a04-099-s01-00.png	Earl Russell
a04-099-s01-01.png	believes :
a04-099-s02-00.png	 It is very questionable whether
a04-099-s02-01.png	British membership of Nato and British
a04-099-s02-02.png	permission of American bases on our territory
a04-099-s02-03.png	add anything to the strength of America ,
a04-099-s02-04.png	while , on the contrary , they impose upon
a04-099-s02-05.png	America an onerous obligation which it
a04-099-s02-06.png	may prove impossible to fulfil . 
a04-103-s00-00.png	The third reason is that the supreme
a04-103-s00-01.png	interest for the whole world - East and
a04-103-s00-02.png	West and uncommitted nations - is the
a04-103-s00-03.png	prevention of nuclear war .
a04-103-s01-00.png	 A rapidly
a04-103-s01-01.png	growing body of opinion in this country
a04-103-s01-02.png	believes that Britain could be more effective
a04-103-s01-03.png	in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
a04-103-s01-04.png	by helping to suggest agreements which could
a04-103-s01-05.png	be accepted by both East and West . 
a05-000-s00-00.png	THE next White Paper on defence , to
a05-000-s00-01.png	be published in March , is likely to
a05-000-s00-02.png	contain a five-year plan for the three
a05-000-s00-03.png	Services .
a05-000-s01-00.png	Its aim will be to produce superbly
a05-000-s01-01.png	equipped , all-Regular forces of
a05-000-s01-02.png	about 400,000 men .
a05-000-s02-00.png	The three Services
a05-000-s02-01.png	would be integrated to a greater
a05-000-s02-02.png	extent than ever before .
a05-004-s00-00.png	Short of wearing the same uniform , which is
a05-004-s00-01.png	not contemplated , the Navy , Army and Royal
a05-004-s00-02.png	Air Force would become , for practical purposes ,
a05-004-s00-03.png	a single defence force .
a05-004-s01-00.png	There would be
a05-004-s01-01.png	complete co-operation at all levels in training
a05-004-s01-02.png	and operations .
a05-004-s02-00.png	This would apply also in the
a05-004-s02-01.png	command structure and central administrative
a05-004-s02-02.png	organisation .
a05-004-s03-00.png	Mr. Watkinson , Minister of Defence ,
a05-004-s03-01.png	has been working on the plan for some months ,
a05-004-s03-02.png	with the Prime Minister's approval .
a05-009-s00-00.png	He has had numerous meetings with the Service
a05-009-s00-01.png	Ministers .
a05-009-s01-00.png	He has also had talks with the Earl
a05-009-s01-01.png	of Home , Foreign Secretary , and with other
a05-009-s01-02.png	Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
a05-009-s01-03.png	of defence policy .
a05-009-s02-00.png	Details of the scheme
a05-009-s02-01.png	are now being worked out by the Chiefs
a05-009-s02-02.png	of Staff , a process that may take four
a05-009-s02-03.png	or five months .
a05-013-s00-00.png	The scheme will be subject to Cabinet
a05-013-s00-01.png	approval .
a05-013-s01-00.png	Mr. Watkinson remains con-
a05-013-s01-01.png	vinced that the policy initiated in
a05-013-s01-02.png	1957 , in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister
a05-013-s01-03.png	of Defence , is still correct .
a05-013-s02-00.png	This was to
a05-013-s02-01.png	return to the tradition of all-Regular
a05-013-s02-02.png	voluntary forces , with the last National
a05-013-s02-03.png	Serviceman out of uniform by the end
a05-013-s02-04.png	of 1962 .
a05-017-s00-00.png	The Minister regards the recent trend
a05-017-s00-01.png	of recruiting figures as encouraging .
a05-017-s01-00.png	He is confident the aim can be achieved .
a05-017-s02-00.png	While the possibility of an eventual return
a05-017-s02-01.png	to National Service in some form
a05-017-s02-02.png	cannot be entirely discounted , he does
a05-017-s02-03.png	not agree that the point has been reached
a05-017-s02-04.png	where this need even be considered .
a05-017-s03-00.png	If
a05-017-s03-01.png	National Service is ever resorted to ,
a05-017-s03-02.png	engagement would probably have to be for
a05-017-s03-03.png	three years .
a05-022-s00-00.png	It is thought this would be the minimum
a05-022-s00-01.png	necessary for the extended training modern
a05-022-s00-02.png	arms require and to enable each man to
a05-022-s00-03.png	serve at least a year overseas .
a05-022-s01-00.png	There is
a05-022-s01-01.png	no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
a05-022-s01-02.png	is at odds with the Service chiefs over
a05-022-s01-03.png	the decision to dispense with National
a05-022-s01-04.png	Service , or over any other aspect of
a05-022-s01-05.png	defence policy .
a05-025-s00-00.png	Criticisms about Army manpower appear
a05-025-s00-01.png	to have come mainly from retired officers
a05-025-s00-02.png	who have held high positions but
a05-025-s00-03.png	are out of touch with the existing situation .
a05-025-s01-00.png	Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
a05-025-s01-01.png	from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir
a05-025-s01-02.png	Francis Festing , who believes completely
a05-025-s01-03.png	in the principle of an all-Regular army .
a05-025-s02-00.png	Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed
a05-025-s02-01.png	Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr.
a05-025-s02-02.png	Watkinson is right .
a05-029-s00-00.png	Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
a05-029-s00-01.png	as from Nov. 1 .
a05-029-s01-00.png	The hand-over , due in
a05-029-s01-01.png	September , was delayed because of the
a05-029-s01-02.png	Berlin crisis .
a05-029-s02-00.png	Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
a05-029-s02-01.png	felt the change would be unwise at a
a05-029-s02-02.png	moment # when attention had to be
a05-029-s02-03.png	concentrated on possible need for important
a05-029-s02-04.png	military operations .
a05-029-s03-00.png	For this reason Sir
a05-029-s03-01.png	Francis stayed on , and # sacrificed
a05-029-s03-02.png	his leave .
a05-039-s00-00.png	There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing
a05-039-s00-01.png	towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd ,
a05-039-s00-02.png	the Prime Minister .
a05-039-s01-00.png	This implies the dis-
a05-039-s01-01.png	appearance of the Progressive party from
a05-039-s01-02.png	the House .
a05-039-s02-00.png	Early results in yesterday's
a05-039-s02-01.png	general election showed Nationalists being
a05-039-s02-02.png	returned in their strongholds , like Bloem-
a05-039-s02-03.png	fontein and the Transvaal , with slightly
a05-039-s02-04.png	increased majorities .
a05-039-s03-00.png	In the Cape , the
a05-039-s03-01.png	veteran United Party politician , Mr. Harry
a05-039-s03-02.png	Lawrence , standing as a Progressive , was
a05-044-s00-00.png	The defeat of the leader of the
a05-044-s00-01.png	Progressive party , Dr. Steytler , in Port
a05-044-s00-02.png	Elizabeth South , announced immediately
a05-044-s00-03.png	afterwards by the United party candidate ,
a05-044-s00-04.png	Mr. Plewman , left the Progressives deprived
a05-044-s00-05.png	of both their chief figures .
a05-044-s01-00.png	Dr. Verwoerd and
a05-044-s01-01.png	the Leader of the Opposition , Sir de
a05-044-s01-02.png	Villiers Graaff , have been returned unopposed .
a05-044-s02-00.png	The contests were for 86 seats as 70
a05-044-s02-01.png	Nationalists and 20 United party candi-
a05-044-s02-02.png	dates are unopposed .
a05-048-s00-00.png	Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was
a05-048-s00-01.png	evident that voters were bored by the
a05-048-s00-02.png	Government's frequent appeals to the electorate .
a05-048-s01-00.png	The election was the fourth in four years .
a05-048-s02-00.png	In most constituencies it may go down as
a05-048-s02-01.png	the most apathetic in the country's history .
a05-048-s03-00.png	THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
a05-048-s03-01.png	last night that he had considered early
a05-048-s03-02.png	in the Parliamentary recess whether to
a05-048-s03-03.png	mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
a05-048-s03-04.png	British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing .
a05-053-s00-00.png	He decided that it would be a great error
a05-053-s00-01.png	to do so and to recall Parliament .
a05-053-s01-00.png	But
a05-053-s01-01.png	there would be no hesitation in mobilising
a05-053-s01-02.png	if a further deterioration in the situation
a05-053-s01-03.png	warranted such a step .
a05-053-s02-00.png	It would have to be
a05-053-s02-01.png	accompanied by other measures of a military ,
a05-053-s02-02.png	economic and political kind .
a05-053-s03-00.png	Mr. Macmillan ,
a05-053-s03-01.png	who was winding up the foreign affairs
a05-053-s03-02.png	debate , said the Government could not
a05-053-s03-03.png	be party to accepting as a matter of
a05-053-s03-04.png	principle the imposed division of Germany .
a05-058-s00-00.png	 We must not be rattled into surrender ,
a05-058-s00-01.png	but we must not - and I am not - be
a05-058-s00-02.png	afraid of negotiation . 
a05-058-s01-00.png	Mr. Godber ,
a05-058-s01-01.png	Minister of State , Foreign Office , said
a05-058-s01-02.png	earlier that the Government had asked
a05-058-s01-03.png	the Medical Research Council to reassess
a05-058-s01-04.png	the fall-out position in view of the Russian
a05-058-s01-05.png	tests .
a05-058-s02-00.png	The Council's findings would be
a05-058-s02-01.png	made public .
a05-062-s00-00.png	With a vigour and authority which delighted
a05-062-s00-01.png	old Parliamentary friends and foes alike ,
a05-062-s00-02.png	the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony
a05-062-s00-03.png	Eden , in his maiden speech in the House
a05-062-s00-04.png	of Lords last night , gave a warning
a05-062-s00-05.png	that # appeasement over Berlin could
a05-062-s00-06.png	only lead to war .
a05-062-s01-00.png	To stand firm , he
a05-062-s01-01.png	declared , was not to invite war , but
a05-062-s01-02.png	the surest way to avert it .
a05-069-s00-00.png	It was the end of a rather curious
a05-069-s00-01.png	speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
a05-069-s00-02.png	the two-day debate on foreign affairs .
a05-069-s01-00.png	He began in a low , almost chatty mono-
a05-069-s01-01.png	tone , and his voice never rose to any
a05-069-s01-02.png	accent of urgency .
a05-069-s02-00.png	He passed in rapid
a05-069-s02-01.png	review the United Nations Secretariat ;
a05-069-s02-02.png	nuclear tests ; the canard about British
a05-069-s02-03.png	interference with the United Nations
a05-069-s02-04.png	in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East
a05-069-s02-05.png	Asia .
a05-073-s00-00.png	He spent most of his short half-hour on
a05-073-s00-01.png	Berlin .
a05-073-s01-00.png	He deplored the possibility of
a05-073-s01-01.png	some new myth about betrayal of Germany
a05-073-s01-02.png	by the Allies .
a05-073-s02-00.png	 We do not , he said , really
a05-073-s02-01.png	know what the Russians want . 
a05-073-s03-00.png	But he was
a05-073-s03-01.png	certain that they wanted to establish a
a05-073-s03-02.png	final and irrevocable division of Germany .
a05-073-s04-00.png	Britain could not be a party to an imposed
a05-073-s04-01.png	division .
a05-073-s05-00.png	But negotiation , as the debate had
a05-073-s05-01.png	shown , could be undertaken on a variety
a05-073-s05-02.png	of bases .
a05-080-s00-00.png	Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
a05-080-s00-01.png	ately refrained during the summer from
a05-080-s00-02.png	recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
a05-080-s00-03.png	by proclamation , such as would be
a05-080-s00-04.png	necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
a05-080-s00-05.png	on to a fully active footing .
a05-080-s01-00.png	That
a05-080-s01-01.png	would have created a thoroughly unde-
a05-080-s01-02.png	sirable atmosphere of panic .
a05-080-s02-00.png	He thought
a05-080-s02-01.png	that the situation was rather more
a05-080-s02-02.png	hopeful .
a05-084-s00-00.png	The Russians now realised its seriousness .
a05-084-s01-00.png	The
a05-084-s01-01.png	French doubts were more about procedure
a05-084-s01-02.png	than about substance .
a05-084-s02-00.png	The Prime Minister's
a05-084-s02-01.png	attitude of studied calm brought down the
a05-084-s02-02.png	temperature of the debate , which never
a05-084-s02-03.png	at any time rose to fever pitch , to a
a05-084-s02-04.png	remarkable degree of sub-normality .
a05-084-s03-00.png	Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
a05-084-s03-01.png	of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening
a05-084-s03-02.png	in the Peers' Gallery .
a05-089-s00-00.png	The early speakers in the debate each
a05-089-s00-01.png	severely rated the speech of his predecessor .
a05-089-s01-00.png	These strictures were all too well justified .
a05-089-s02-00.png	We started with the plaintive wailings
a05-089-s02-01.png	of Mr. Healey , Shadow Foreign Secretary ,
a05-089-s02-02.png	described by Mr. Godber , Minister of
a05-089-s02-03.png	State , Foreign Office , as pedantic and
a05-089-s02-04.png	obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure
a05-089-s02-05.png	on the Congo . 
a05-089-s03-00.png	In turn , Mr. Godber was
a05-089-s03-01.png	censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour
a05-089-s03-02.png	Defence Minister , for having read the
a05-094-s00-00.png	The trouble about such debates is that
a05-094-s00-01.png	they range too widely .
a05-094-s01-00.png	They remind one of
a05-094-s01-01.png	the Rugby match in Tom Brown's Schooldays , 
a05-094-s01-02.png	in which all the boys were welcome to
a05-094-s01-03.png	take part , and only those who really meant
a05-094-s01-04.png	business removed their jackets .
a05-094-s02-00.png	Not many
a05-094-s02-01.png	metaphorical braces were visible in the
a05-094-s02-02.png	early stages of to-night's debate .
a05-094-s03-00.png	Mr.
a05-094-s03-01.png	Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
a05-094-s03-02.png	golf-course Press conference , which he
a05-094-s03-03.png	described as a display of flabby and
a05-099-s00-00.png	A reference to the reunification of Germany
a05-099-s00-01.png	brought a bark of Start another war ! 
a05-099-s00-02.png	from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) .
a05-099-s01-00.png	Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
a05-099-s01-01.png	theme of limitation of armaments in Europe .
a05-099-s02-00.png	This could , he suggested , be linked with
a05-099-s02-01.png	prohibition of the production of atomic
a05-099-s02-02.png	weapons in any part of Europe .
a05-099-s03-00.png	Inspection
a05-099-s03-01.png	and control would be much easier to
a05-099-s03-02.png	establish in these territories .
a05-104-s00-00.png	Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
a05-104-s00-01.png	using double standards .
a05-104-s01-00.png	Ministers had
a05-104-s01-01.png	rebuked the unaligned nations for not
a05-104-s01-02.png	condemning the new Russian tests , but
a05-104-s01-03.png	they themselves had no condemnation for
a05-104-s01-04.png	events in Angola or Algeria .
a05-104-s02-00.png	It was not for
a05-104-s02-01.png	the Government , said Mr. Healey , to
a05-104-s02-02.png	take up moral attitudes , especially when
a05-104-s02-03.png	the temple of their religion is the
a05-104-s02-04.png	bingo-parlour . 
a05-108-s00-00.png	This puzzled such students of comparative
a05-108-s00-01.png	religion as had failed to detect this cult .
a05-108-s01-00.png	But Mr. Healey had a partial and
a05-108-s01-01.png	limited success .
a05-108-s02-00.png	He rallied behind him
a05-108-s02-01.png	the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last
a05-108-s02-02.png	night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell .
a05-108-s03-00.png	Mr.
a05-108-s03-01.png	Godber's performance merited all the mild
a05-108-s03-02.png	scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell .
a05-113-s00-00.png	True , he did tell the House that the
a05-113-s00-01.png	Government had asked the Medical Research
a05-113-s00-02.png	Council to reassess the fall-out position in
a05-113-s00-03.png	view of the Russian tests , and said that
a05-113-s00-04.png	the council's findings would be published .
a05-113-s01-00.png	He was not so happy in his defence of
a05-113-s01-01.png	the Government's failure to condemn
a05-113-s01-02.png	France for her nuclear tests in the
a05-113-s01-03.png	Sahara on the grounds that they were
a05-113-s01-04.png	only little ones .
a05-116-s00-00.png	This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
a05-116-s00-01.png	and her illegitimate baby .
a05-116-s01-00.png	For the most
a05-116-s01-01.png	part , Mr. Godber muttered his way
a05-116-s01-02.png	through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office
a05-116-s01-03.png	brief .
a05-116-s02-00.png	He resembles the elephant seal , an
a05-116-s02-01.png	# otherwise endearing creature whose
a05-116-s02-02.png	articulation is limited , we are told , to a
a05-116-s02-03.png	series of heavy sighs .
a05-116-s03-00.png	Sir Lynn Ungoed-
a05-116-s03-01.png	Thomas , M.P. for Leicester N.E. , a former
a05-116-s03-02.png	Labour Solicitor-General , and Mrs. Barbara
a05-121-s00-00.png	It was signed by 60 Labour M.P.s , many
a05-121-s00-01.png	of them Left-wing # sympathisers .
a05-121-s01-00.png	It condemned the pollution of the world's
a05-121-s01-01.png	atmosphere as a crime against humanity . 
a05-121-s02-00.png	A personal letter of protest against the
a05-121-s02-01.png	tests from Canon Collins , chairman
a05-121-s02-02.png	of the Campaign for Nuclear
a05-121-s02-03.png	Disarmament , addressed to Mr.
a05-121-s02-04.png	# Khruschev , was also taken to the
a05-121-s02-05.png	Russian Embassy .
a05-125-s00-00.png	A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT writes :
a05-125-s01-00.png	Ban-the-
a05-125-s01-01.png	bomb demonstrators thronged the Central
a05-125-s01-02.png	Lobby of the House of Commons last
a05-125-s01-03.png	night and formed a queue stretching
a05-125-s01-04.png	for more than 200 yards outside
a05-125-s01-05.png	in Old Palace Yard .
a05-125-s02-00.png	About 2,000
a05-125-s02-01.png	lobbied M.P.s and harangued them
a05-125-s02-02.png	on disarmament .
a06-000-s00-00.png	MR SELWYN LLOYD may speed up his plans
a06-000-s00-01.png	to catch speculators in shares and property .
a06-000-s01-00.png	The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to
a06-000-s01-01.png	public opinion over his July Budget came
a06-000-s01-02.png	dramatically in the Commons yesterday .
a06-000-s02-00.png	Mr
a06-000-s02-01.png	Lloyd said on # Tuesday that he proposed
a06-000-s02-02.png	to deal in his next regular Budget with
a06-000-s02-03.png	some profits which now escape tax .
a06-004-s00-00.png	Sir Edward Boyle , Financial Secretary
a06-004-s00-01.png	to the Treasury , said yesterday that the
a06-004-s00-02.png	Government does not like retrospective legislation .
a06-004-s01-00.png	He went on to describe the kind of
a06-004-s01-01.png	people the Chancellor hopes to tax .
a06-004-s02-00.png	These
a06-004-s02-01.png	are people buying and selling shares within
a06-004-s02-02.png	a short period , those stagging on a new issue
a06-004-s02-03.png	and property dealers who form a chain of
a06-004-s02-04.png	companies and put one property deal through
a06-004-s02-05.png	each .
a06-008-s00-00.png	Mr. Harold Wilson , Shadow Chancellor , jumped up to
a06-008-s00-01.png	offer the Government an easy passage for such
a06-008-s00-02.png	legislation .
a06-008-s01-00.png	 Why don't you make proposals to legislate
a06-008-s01-01.png	in the autumn ? Mr. Wilson asked .
a06-008-s02-00.png	 We wouldn't call
a06-008-s02-01.png	it an Autumn Budget .
a06-008-s03-00.png	You can call it a Taxation
a06-008-s03-01.png	Management Bill , if you like . 
a06-008-s04-00.png	While Mr. Wilson
a06-008-s04-01.png	was speaking , the Prime Minister and Mr. Lloyd
a06-008-s04-02.png	had a whispered conversation .
a06-014-s00-00.png	They nodded at each other and Sir Edward
a06-014-s00-01.png	rose to say that the Chancellor would bear
a06-014-s00-02.png	Mr. Wilson's offer in mind .
a06-014-s01-00.png	Guy Eden writes :
a06-014-s02-00.png	Treasury experts are already working on
a06-014-s02-01.png	the scheme .
a06-014-s03-00.png	Profits of genuine investors
a06-014-s03-01.png	in industry will not be affected , but only
a06-014-s03-02.png	quick in-and-out speculator deals .
a06-014-s04-00.png	FRANK FOULKES , Communist president
a06-014-s04-01.png	of the ETU , refused yesterday to
a06-014-s04-02.png	 commit suicide at the TUC's
a06-014-s04-03.png	invitation .
a06-020-s00-00.png	He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to the
a06-020-s00-01.png	ETU.
a06-020-s01-00.png	In reply to the call for his resignation he said :
a06-020-s02-00.png	 Our rules
a06-020-s02-01.png	say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to run again
a06-020-s02-02.png	for three years .
a06-020-s03-00.png	 I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire ,
a06-020-s03-01.png	so this is an invitation from my good friends of the TUC that
a06-020-s03-02.png	I should commit hara-kiri .
a06-025-s00-00.png	The other TUC demands :
a06-025-s01-00.png	Five leading
a06-025-s01-01.png	Communists must not hold office for five
a06-025-s01-02.png	years ;
a06-025-s02-00.png	Sub-committees set up to strip
a06-025-s02-01.png	secretary John Byrne of his powers must
a06-025-s02-02.png	disband in ten days .
a06-025-s03-00.png	These the ETU
a06-025-s03-01.png	executive rejected as wholly unacceptable 
a06-025-s03-02.png	and unwarranted interference . 
a06-025-s04-00.png	But it
a06-025-s04-01.png	agreed to postpone operation of the sub-
a06-025-s04-02.png	committees .
a06-036-s00-00.png	The small rocket craft , for destroying big
a06-036-s00-01.png	ships , are controlled automatically , even
a06-036-s00-02.png	to the preparations for launching their
a06-036-s00-03.png	rockets .
a06-036-s01-00.png	Applauding on the river banks at
a06-036-s01-01.png	Leningrad were thousands now told that in
a06-036-s01-02.png	20 years they will have free food , housing , light ,
a06-036-s01-03.png	heat , transport and medical treatment - all
a06-036-s01-04.png	for a working week of 34 to 36 hours .
a06-039-s00-00.png	 The whole naval might of the Soviet
a06-039-s00-01.png	Union can be seen here - a truly inspiring
a06-039-s00-02.png	and proud sight , said Moscow radio's
a06-039-s00-03.png	commentator .
a06-039-s01-00.png	The parade was reviewed by
a06-039-s01-01.png	Marshal Andrei Grechko , commanding the
a06-039-s01-02.png	forces of the Warsaw Pact countries -
a06-039-s01-03.png	the Communist Nato . 
a06-039-s02-00.png	He said rocket-

a06-039-s03-00.png	MR.
a06-039-s03-01.png	MACMILLAN'S announcement in the
a06-039-s03-02.png	Commons of his momentous
a06-044-s00-00.png	Mr. Anthony Fell ( Yarmouth ) called the decision shocking 
a06-044-s00-01.png	and added :
a06-044-s01-00.png	 It is the most disastrous thing any Prime
a06-044-s01-01.png	Minister has done for many , many generations . 
a06-044-s02-00.png	He
a06-044-s02-01.png	concluded :
a06-044-s03-00.png	 The best service the Prime Minister can do
a06-044-s03-01.png	would be to resign . 
a06-044-s04-00.png	The outburst shocked MPs of
a06-044-s04-01.png	all parties .
a06-044-s05-00.png	Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell
a06-044-s05-01.png	to stop .
a06-051-s00-00.png	There were loud cries of shame from
a06-051-s00-01.png	all parts of the Conservative side .
a06-051-s01-00.png	Mr.
a06-051-s01-01.png	Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat
a06-051-s01-02.png	down .
a06-051-s02-00.png	A few minutes later , Mr. Fell got up
a06-051-s02-01.png	and left the chamber .
a06-051-s03-00.png	He returned five
a06-051-s03-01.png	minutes later to stand just inside the
a06-051-s03-02.png	doorway looking more composed .
a06-051-s04-00.png	In the
a06-051-s04-01.png	middle of the amazing scene , Mr. Macmillan
a06-051-s04-02.png	waved his hand at Mr. Fell .
a06-057-s00-00.png	This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more .
a06-057-s01-00.png	 I cannot be told
a06-057-s01-01.png	to sit down by the Prime Minister . 
a06-057-s02-00.png	Protests had been expected
a06-057-s02-01.png	from Tory rebels .
a06-057-s03-00.png	But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented .
a06-057-s04-00.png	He
a06-057-s04-01.png	accused the Prime Minister of political double talk . 
a06-057-s05-00.png	 It had
a06-057-s05-01.png	the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
a06-057-s05-02.png	Minister is a national disaster , he said .
a06-064-s00-00.png	Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had , if
a06-064-s00-01.png	anything , rallied support to the Prime Minister .
a06-064-s01-00.png	This apparently , was Mr. Macmillan's assessment .
a06-064-s02-00.png	He confined his reply to the observation
a06-064-s02-01.png	that Mr. Fell had probably maximised his
a06-064-s02-02.png	support . 
a06-064-s03-00.png	There were no other attacks
a06-064-s03-01.png	of such ferocity .
a06-064-s04-00.png	But there was ample
a06-064-s04-01.png	evidence of Conservative and Labour
a06-064-s04-02.png	opposition , which will be aired in the
a06-064-s04-03.png	debate tomorrow and on Thursday .
a06-070-s00-00.png	As Mr. Macmillan made his announcement , the
a06-070-s00-01.png	House was crowded .
a06-070-s01-00.png	He said : 
a06-070-s02-00.png	No # British
a06-070-s02-01.png	Government could join the European Economic
a06-070-s02-02.png	Community without prior negotiation with a view
a06-070-s02-03.png	to meeting the needs of the Commonwealth countries ,
a06-070-s02-04.png	of our European Free Trade Association partners
a06-070-s02-05.png	and of British agriculture . 
a06-070-s03-00.png	Near the end of a
a06-070-s03-01.png	long statement , Mr. Macmillan stated the
a06-070-s03-02.png	Government's intention :
a06-075-s00-00.png	 After long and earnest consideration , Her
a06-075-s00-01.png	Majesty's Government have come to the
a06-075-s00-02.png	conclusion that it would be right for
a06-075-s00-03.png	Britain to make a formal application . .
a06-075-s00-04.png	for negotiations with a view to joining
a06-075-s00-05.png	the Community . 
a06-075-s01-00.png	At this point , Mr. Paul
a06-075-s01-01.png	Williams ( Cons. , Sunderland ) called out
a06-075-s02-00.png	 Shame . 
a06-075-s03-00.png	Mr. Williams is a close
a06-075-s03-01.png	associate of Mr. Fell .
a06-090-s00-00.png	He claimed that , unless we were in the
a06-090-s00-01.png	Common Market , we should not be able to
a06-090-s00-02.png	play any part in # determining its future .
a06-090-s01-00.png	 We can lead better from within , he said .
a06-090-s02-00.png	Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection
a06-090-s02-01.png	raised by Tory critics .
a06-090-s03-00.png	Mr. Anthony Fell ,
a06-090-s03-01.png	who created a scene on this point on
a06-090-s03-02.png	Monday , took up a position almost hidden
a06-090-s03-03.png	behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair .
a06-095-s00-00.png	Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help
a06-095-s00-01.png	to the Commonwealth through the
a06-095-s00-02.png	strength we would gain in the Common
a06-095-s00-03.png	Market than by isolation .
a06-095-s01-00.png	He paid
a06-095-s01-01.png	tribute to the development of the
a06-095-s01-02.png	Common Market .
a06-095-s02-00.png	 The Community
a06-095-s02-01.png	( Common Market ) has imparted an
a06-095-s02-02.png	impetus and an economic growth
a06-095-s02-03.png	to The Six .
a06-095-s03-00.png	Above all , it is an idea
a06-095-s03-01.png	which has gripped men's minds , 
a06-095-s03-02.png	he said .
a06-100-s00-00.png	Referring to previous negotiations , Mr. Macmillan looked towards
a06-100-s00-01.png	Mr. Reginald Maudling .
a06-100-s01-00.png	 These were negotiations in which the
a06-100-s01-01.png	President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part , the
a06-100-s01-02.png	Premier said .
a06-100-s02-00.png	He dismissed the idea that Britain would be
a06-100-s02-01.png	swamped by cheap labour .
a06-100-s03-00.png	Our industry , he said , would
a06-100-s03-01.png	probably gain .
a06-100-s04-00.png	 Many people feel we have had , perhaps , too
a06-100-s04-01.png	much shelter , he went on .
a06-110-s00-00.png	Conservatives protested when
a06-110-s00-01.png	Mr. Gaitskell said he had been
a06-110-s00-02.png	told
a06-110-s01-00.png	this by some # people
a06-110-s01-01.png	of considerable authority , he
a06-110-s01-02.png	retorted .
a06-110-s02-00.png	 I agree with the Prime
a06-110-s02-01.png	Minister that I do not think
a06-110-s02-02.png	we are necessarily bound for
a06-110-s02-03.png	federalism in Europe , he went
a06-110-s02-04.png	on .
a06-114-s00-00.png	If we joined the Common Market , our
a06-114-s00-01.png	food subsidies would probably be
a06-114-s00-02.png	replaced by a system of tariffs
a06-114-s01-00.png	 That
a06-114-s01-01.png	will mean a rise in the cost of living . 
a06-114-s02-00.png	BUDGETTE or no Budgette YOU are
a06-114-s02-01.png	spending more as the summer holiday
a06-114-s02-02.png	season moves into top gear .
a06-114-s03-00.png	On the eve of August Bank Holiday
a06-114-s03-01.png	the spending spree is at a new
a06-114-s03-02.png	all-time peak .
a06-119-s00-00.png	Note circulation soared for the
a06-119-s00-01.png	sixth successive week - this
a06-119-s00-02.png	time by more than 15,000,000 # last
a06-119-s00-03.png	week .
a06-119-s01-00.png	And that brought the figure
a06-119-s01-01.png	to a record 2,415,000,000 .
a06-119-s02-00.png	This was
a06-119-s02-01.png	100,000,000 more than the corresponding
a06-119-s02-02.png	week last year and 37,000,000 up on
a06-119-s02-03.png	the 1960 record set last Christmas .
a06-119-s03-00.png	Now look at the other side of all
a06-119-s03-01.png	these coins .
a06-124-s00-00.png	The big squeeze means that it is going to be more
a06-124-s00-01.png	difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft .
a06-124-s01-00.png	And banks will be
a06-124-s01-01.png	stricter in recalling existing overdrafts .
a06-124-s02-00.png	This is underlined in
a06-124-s02-01.png	the Central Bank's weekly return ... ... which shows that more
a06-124-s02-02.png	than 163,000,000 of the banks' money is now frozen in the
a06-124-s02-03.png	form of special deposits with the Bank of England .
a06-128-s00-00.png	Banks have paid in a first
a06-128-s00-01.png	instalment of almost 8,000,000
a06-128-s00-02.png	in response to the Budgette appeal .
a06-128-s01-00.png	About another 70,000,000 is due
a06-128-s01-01.png	by September 20 .
a06-128-s02-00.png	For nearly a year
a06-128-s02-01.png	about 150,000,000 has been frozen .
a06-128-s03-00.png	MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of
a06-128-s03-01.png	German militarism in his replies to
a06-128-s03-02.png	the West on Berlin .
a06-128-s04-00.png	And he repeats
a06-128-s04-01.png	that the problem must be solved
a06-128-s04-02.png	this year . 
a06-134-s00-00.png	The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to
a06-134-s00-01.png	West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday .
a06-134-s01-00.png	They
a06-134-s01-01.png	tell :
a06-134-s02-00.png	The U.S. -
a06-134-s03-00.png	It is false to say the absence of a peace
a06-134-s03-01.png	treaty with Germany causes no real danger .
a06-134-s04-00.png	West Germany ,
a06-134-s04-01.png	with its militarists and revenge-seekers , is becoming a
a06-134-s04-02.png	hotbed of war danger in Europe .
a06-134-s05-00.png	Even now , aided by
a06-134-s05-01.png	the U.S. , Britain and France , it has more than enough
a06-134-s05-02.png	forces and arms to touch off a world war .
a06-141-s00-00.png	BRITAIN -
a06-141-s01-00.png	One cannot but wonder at British bases being
a06-141-s01-01.png	put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed
a06-141-s01-02.png	Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British
a06-141-s01-03.png	cities .
a06-141-s02-00.png	FRANCE -
a06-141-s03-00.png	One can hardly conceive the French are
a06-141-s03-01.png	not alarmed ... .
a06-141-s04-00.png	Next door , in West Germany , before everyone's
a06-141-s04-01.png	eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi
a06-141-s04-02.png	generals and officers .
a06-147-s00-00.png	With fire and sword France denies Algeria the right to self-
a06-147-s00-01.png	determination and tramples on Tunisians' right to independence .
a06-147-s01-00.png	WEST GERMANY -
a06-147-s02-00.png	Russia would like to see a clear #
a06-147-s02-01.png	realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours
a06-147-s02-02.png	of a third world war .
a06-147-s03-00.png	The best way to rule out such a tragic
a06-147-s03-01.png	contingency would be to sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous
a06-147-s03-02.png	growth of West Berlin's occupation status .
a06-152-s00-00.png	Behind Bonn's slogan of German self-
a06-152-s00-01.png	determination is the intention to impose
a06-152-s00-02.png	on East Germany the regime existing in
a06-152-s00-03.png	West Germany .
a06-152-s01-00.png	REFUGEES are pouring out
a06-152-s01-01.png	# of East Germany into West
a06-152-s01-02.png	Berlin faster than ever .
a06-152-s02-00.png	Mr. K's latest
a06-152-s02-01.png	speech scared 1,157 East Germans to
a06-152-s02-02.png	cross into West Berlin's reception centre
a06-152-s02-03.png	DURING MONDAY NIGHT .
a06-152-s03-00.png	And officials
a06-152-s03-01.png	expect the total to leap to
a06-152-s03-02.png	3,000 a day .
a06-157-s00-00.png	This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the
a06-157-s00-01.png	East German disturbances on July 17 , 1953 .
a06-157-s01-00.png	And officials
a06-157-s01-01.png	fear it may be too much for the city's refugee camps .
a06-157-s02-00.png	They will overflow and private houses will have to be used .
b01-000-s00-00.png	Prime Minister after Prime Minister speaks out
b01-000-s00-01.png	in revulsion against the South African
b01-000-s00-02.png	Government's policy of apartheid as we wait
b01-000-s00-03.png	for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth
b01-000-s00-04.png	Conference in London .
b01-000-s01-00.png	Will it end with
b01-000-s01-01.png	South Africa's exclusion from the
b01-000-s01-02.png	Commonwealth ?
b01-000-s02-00.png	The issue is touch and go .
b01-004-s00-00.png	There is a possibility that it will not be
b01-004-s00-01.png	settled at this conference .
b01-004-s01-00.png	It may be agreed to
b01-004-s01-01.png	wait until South Africa actually becomes a
b01-004-s01-02.png	Republic later in the year .
b01-004-s02-00.png	But if a final
b01-004-s02-01.png	decision is to be faced now , on which side
b01-004-s02-02.png	do the strongest arguments lie ?
b01-004-s03-00.png	THE Archbishop
b01-004-s03-01.png	of Capetown has shown that the matter is
b01-004-s03-02.png	not clear-cut .
b01-009-s00-00.png	The Archbishop has long been a courageous
b01-009-s00-01.png	fighter against apartheid .
b01-009-s01-00.png	He must be heard
b01-009-s01-01.png	with attention .
b01-009-s02-00.png	On purely practical grounds he
b01-009-s02-01.png	holds that it would be a mistake to expel
b01-009-s02-02.png	South Africa , weakening the whites who are
b01-009-s02-03.png	working for a change of policy .
b01-009-s03-00.png	In his view
b01-009-s03-01.png	it would also be against the interests of the
b01-009-s03-02.png	Africans .
b01-014-s00-00.png	He holds that more pressure can be put on South
b01-014-s00-01.png	Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth
b01-014-s00-02.png	than could be exercised were she cut off from it .
b01-014-s01-00.png	On the other hand , those who favour expulsion , inclu-
b01-014-s01-01.png	ding African leaders , feel that nothing less than the
b01-014-s01-02.png	shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.
b01-014-s01-03.png	Verwoerd and the Nationalists .
b01-014-s02-00.png	They point out
b01-014-s02-01.png	that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning
b01-014-s02-02.png	the apartheid policy .
b01-018-s00-00.png	THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society .
b01-018-s01-00.png	A
b01-018-s01-01.png	policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries
b01-018-s01-02.png	is surely the one thing that it could not survive .
b01-018-s02-00.png	Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in
b01-018-s02-01.png	London , millions at home would regard as fraudulent
b01-018-s02-02.png	a Commonwealth which had room for a racist
b01-018-s02-03.png	South Africa .
b01-018-s03-00.png	And this is a Commonwealth in
b01-018-s03-01.png	which five citizens are coloured for every one
b01-018-s03-02.png	who is white .
b01-023-s00-00.png	Seen in this wider picture , a South Africa that clings to
b01-023-s00-01.png	apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a
b01-023-s00-02.png	liability to the whole Western world .
b01-023-s01-00.png	A practical
b01-023-s01-01.png	solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft
b01-023-s01-02.png	a set of principles excluding race discrimination .
b01-023-s02-00.png	And so leave South Africa to make the grade ,
b01-023-s02-01.png	or go out .
b01-027-s00-00.png	THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
b01-027-s00-01.png	tonight from their tour in the East .
b01-027-s01-00.png	The duke's
b01-027-s01-01.png	trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts
b01-027-s01-02.png	have taken the headlines in this country .
b01-027-s02-00.png	Nevertheless , the tour has been an immense
b01-027-s02-01.png	success .
b01-027-s03-00.png	The Queen has won a triumph .
b01-027-s04-00.png	It
b01-027-s04-01.png	would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
b01-027-s04-02.png	performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
b01-027-s04-03.png	dropped from future Royal programmes .
b01-033-s00-00.png	But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by
b01-033-s00-01.png	their visit .
b01-033-s01-00.png	The warmth of their welcome in India and
b01-033-s01-01.png	Pakistan are happy memories .
b01-033-s02-00.png	WEST GERMANY - followed
b01-033-s02-01.png	yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture
b01-033-s02-02.png	of a good neighbour .
b01-033-s03-00.png	She has put up the value
b01-033-s03-01.png	of her money .
b01-038-s00-00.png	Certainly , the rise is very small .
b01-038-s01-00.png	But it is a step
b01-038-s01-01.png	in the direction of live-and-let-live .
b01-038-s02-00.png	Hopes
b01-038-s02-01.png	will now grow brighter of further international
b01-038-s02-02.png	co-operation , which is the only way to solve the
b01-038-s02-03.png	payments difficulties that upset the Western world .
b01-038-s03-00.png	Britain and the U.S. , which have problems with
b01-038-s03-01.png	their balances , will gain some immediate help .
b01-038-s04-00.png	What it means in practical terms is that our
b01-038-s04-01.png	exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
b01-038-s04-02.png	for Germans to buy , while the goods which
b01-038-s04-03.png	Germany exports will be made a little dearer .
b01-044-s00-00.png	Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports
b01-044-s00-01.png	as a means to curb rising prices at home .
b01-044-s01-00.png	She is
b01-044-s01-01.png	also aware how # unpopular she has been growing
b01-044-s01-02.png	by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation
b01-044-s01-03.png	should .
b01-044-s02-00.png	Germany exports much more than she imports .
b01-044-s03-00.png	For upwards of five years the world's reserves of
b01-044-s03-01.png	dollars have been drained into Germany .
b01-049-s00-00.png	There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
b01-049-s00-01.png	Germany has no tradition of trading abroad .
b01-049-s01-00.png	In addition
b01-049-s01-01.png	the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted
b01-049-s01-02.png	speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars ,
b01-049-s01-03.png	hoping for the mark to rise , as has now happened .
b01-049-s02-00.png	WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
b01-049-s02-01.png	Germany's massive trading surplus and choke
b01-049-s02-02.png	off speculation against dollar and pound ?
b01-053-s00-00.png	That is doubtful .
b01-053-s01-00.png	If however , in addition to her new
b01-053-s01-01.png	good-neighbour gesture , Germany takes a really big
b01-053-s01-02.png	share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations , the
b01-053-s01-03.png	world outlook will be brighter .
b01-053-s02-00.png	What gives rise
b01-053-s02-01.png	to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
b01-053-s02-02.png	other leading Western nations are at long last
b01-053-s02-03.png	moving towards a solution of currency problems
b01-053-s02-04.png	by co-operation .
b01-057-s00-00.png	A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine , paid
b01-057-s00-01.png	for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament .
b01-057-s01-00.png	Those who lend their names to this kind of
b01-057-s01-01.png	advertisement are worthy people , a little innocent
b01-057-s01-02.png	of politics , perhaps , or carried away by the
b01-057-s01-03.png	idea that moral regeneration would solve
b01-057-s01-04.png	all our problems .
b01-057-s02-00.png	So it would .
b01-057-s03-00.png	While we are
b01-057-s03-01.png	waiting for the millenium , however , most of us
b01-057-s03-02.png	would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
b01-057-s03-03.png	instruments of democracy , such as trade unions
b01-057-s03-04.png	and our local and national Parliaments .
b01-062-s00-00.png	Should the Herald publish such advertisements ?
b01-062-s01-00.png	This is a difficult question .
b01-062-s02-00.png	It would obviously
b01-062-s02-01.png	be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
b01-062-s02-02.png	which we disagree .
b01-062-s03-00.png	When an advertisement
b01-062-s03-01.png	contains statements whose factual truth is
b01-062-s03-02.png	doubtful , or where the total content would be
b01-062-s03-03.png	deeply repugnant to our readers , it is right to
b01-062-s03-04.png	exercise editorial discretion .
b01-062-s04-00.png	The MRA
b01-062-s04-01.png	advertisement falls into neither category , though
b01-062-s04-02.png	many readers will dislike it .
b01-073-s00-00.png	The first reaction of the Sudanese
b01-073-s00-01.png	Government was to denounce the United
b01-073-s00-02.png	Nations for negligence and impotence , and
b01-073-s00-03.png	to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
b01-073-s00-04.png	would be taken home .
b01-073-s01-00.png	The reaction can be
b01-073-s01-01.png	understood .
b01-073-s02-00.png	The Sudan's concern for its
b01-073-s02-01.png	men is natural .
b01-073-s03-00.png	But this could hardly be
b01-073-s03-01.png	a # dignified exit .
b01-073-s04-00.png	IF the UN is
b01-073-s04-01.png	blamed for being weak , it would be
b01-073-s04-02.png	more logical to send in more men ,
b01-073-s04-03.png	not weaken it further by desertion .
b01-079-s00-00.png	It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
b01-079-s00-01.png	Hammarskjold and the UN's servants .
b01-079-s01-00.png	The
b01-079-s01-01.png	responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
b01-079-s01-02.png	which have undertaken the task of pre-
b01-079-s01-03.png	serving peace in the Congo .
b01-079-s02-00.png	That is not a
b01-079-s02-01.png	ceremonial duty , and the soldiers have every
b01-079-s02-02.png	right to blame the politicians unless they see
b01-079-s02-03.png	it through .
b01-079-s03-00.png	When the United Nations instructed
b01-079-s03-01.png	Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
b01-079-s03-02.png	prevent civil war , it was clear that new dangers
b01-079-s03-03.png	would arise unless it gave him the political ...
b01-084-s00-00.png	That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold
b01-084-s00-01.png	made .
b01-084-s01-00.png	India has responded handsomely by providing
b01-084-s01-01.png	3,000 men , who must take about a fortnight to arrive .
b01-084-s02-00.png	If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground ,
b01-084-s02-01.png	such incidents as that at Matadi would not
b01-084-s02-02.png	happen .
b01-084-s03-00.png	THE UN's ability to keep peace depends
b01-084-s03-01.png	simply on adequate support by the nations
b01-084-s03-02.png	which have set their hands to this plough .
b01-089-s00-00.png	The big Powers involved in the Cold War
b01-089-s00-01.png	must of course keep out .
b01-089-s01-00.png	The Americans were
b01-089-s01-01.png	justified in diverting naval ships in case
b01-089-s01-02.png	non-combatant help was wanted ; but they
b01-089-s01-03.png	stressed that there was no intention to intervene
b01-089-s01-04.png	in fighting .
b01-089-s02-00.png	Yesterday the ships turned away
b01-089-s02-01.png	again , satisfied that they were not required .
b01-089-s03-00.png	It is to be hoped that the UN will be
b01-089-s03-01.png	re-established in their port by negotiation
b01-089-s03-02.png	and that there will be no more outrages .
b01-094-s00-00.png	But back , Mr. Hammarskjold is determined ,
b01-094-s00-01.png	they must go .
b01-094-s01-00.png	The best news for the Congo
b01-094-s01-01.png	would be agreement between its rival
b01-094-s01-02.png	political leaders .
b01-094-s02-00.png	Through the patient efforts
b01-094-s02-01.png	of UN conciliators they are meeting for
b01-094-s02-02.png	the first time , in Malagasy ( formerly
b01-094-s02-03.png	Madagascar ) .
b01-094-s03-00.png	THE world will sigh with
b01-094-s03-01.png	relief when this strife-torn land gets
b01-094-s03-02.png	itself a government which all outsiders
b01-094-s03-03.png	can recognise .
b01-113-s00-00.png	ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
b01-113-s00-01.png	as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as a
b01-113-s00-02.png	policy of good neighbourliness . 
b01-113-s01-00.png	We may be sure that
b01-113-s01-01.png	he is not being hypocritical .
b01-113-s02-00.png	That is what he
b01-113-s02-01.png	really believes .
b01-113-s03-00.png	A good neighbour to those Africans
b01-113-s03-01.png	who , under apartheid , will be forced back to
b01-113-s03-02.png	their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
b01-113-s03-03.png	cramped and primitive existence .
b01-118-s00-00.png	A good neighbour to those Africans who will con-
b01-118-s00-01.png	tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of
b01-118-s00-02.png	water in the white areas of South Africa , without rights
b01-118-s00-03.png	and without hope .
b01-118-s01-00.png	THE same sort of good neighbour
b01-118-s01-01.png	that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
b01-118-s01-02.png	Hitler in the thirties .
b01-118-s02-00.png	It was Dr. Verwoerd who
b01-118-s02-01.png	led a protest against admitting any of them
b01-118-s02-02.png	because they would defile the national
b01-118-s02-03.png	white stock .
b01-122-s00-00.png	It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
b01-122-s00-01.png	woerd in his nightmare world .
b01-122-s01-00.png	It is this that
b01-122-s01-01.png	makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
b01-122-s01-02.png	fluenced to change course .
b01-122-s02-00.png	The Archbishop of
b01-122-s02-01.png	Capetown , Dr. Joost de Blank , has pleaded that
b01-122-s02-02.png	South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
b01-122-s02-03.png	Commonwealth .
b01-122-s03-00.png	Otherwise , he says , those inside the
b01-122-s03-01.png	country who still oppose apartheid will be
b01-122-s03-02.png	left even more isolated and alone .
b01-127-s00-00.png	The views of the Archbishop , who has
b01-127-s00-01.png	maintained an unflinching witness to what
b01-127-s00-02.png	Christianity really means , must carry weight .
b01-127-s01-00.png	But
b01-127-s01-01.png	what , in fact , can the other Commonwealth countries
b01-127-s01-02.png	do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
b01-127-s01-03.png	minority ?
b01-127-s02-00.png	THERE is no evidence that the
b01-127-s02-01.png	policy of appeasement has modified the
b01-127-s02-02.png	actions of the Nationalists .
b01-127-s03-00.png	On the contrary ,
b01-127-s03-01.png	apartheid is being applied ever more
b01-127-s03-02.png	ruthlessly .
b01-132-s00-00.png	The shock of expulsion from the
b01-132-s00-01.png	Commonwealth now seems to be the only
b01-132-s00-02.png	way left to try to bring home to the people of
b01-132-s00-03.png	South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
b01-132-s00-04.png	to disaster .
b01-132-s01-00.png	It may be that the Commonwealth
b01-132-s01-01.png	Prime Ministers will decide against this final
b01-132-s01-02.png	step .
b01-132-s02-00.png	If that is their decision they should also
b01-132-s02-01.png	go unequivocally on record that they regard
b01-132-s02-02.png	apartheid as evil and indefensible .
b01-136-s00-00.png	Unless they do at least that , Dr. Verwoerd will
b01-136-s00-01.png	be able to return home claiming a triumph .
b01-136-s01-00.png	His smile will be blander than ever .
b01-136-s02-00.png	WE are in
b01-136-s02-01.png	for it again : another Royal Wedding .
b01-136-s03-00.png	Between
b01-136-s03-01.png	now and June , when the Duke of Kent will
b01-136-s03-02.png	marry Miss Worsley , hardly a day will pass
b01-136-s03-03.png	without a story or a picture or probably both ,
b01-136-s03-04.png	about the nuptial arrangements .
b02-013-s00-00.png	What seems certain is that those who
b02-013-s00-01.png	advocate putting off any approach until
b02-013-s00-02.png	Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change
b02-013-s00-03.png	of heart ( whatever that may mean ) would
b02-013-s00-04.png	have us run risks greater than the West
b02-013-s00-05.png	ought to run - and greater than President
b02-013-s00-06.png	Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
b02-013-s00-07.png	disposed to face .
b02-013-s01-00.png	The real question is
b02-013-s01-01.png	what we should put to the Soviet
b02-013-s01-02.png	Government as a basis for talks : and
b02-035-s00-00.png	On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
b02-035-s00-01.png	manoeuvring , and what we should call
b02-035-s00-02.png	cool-headed and inventive negotiation , is
b02-035-s00-03.png	a means not to destruction but to safety .
b02-035-s01-00.png	The Government's pompous little statement
b02-035-s01-01.png	on Northern Rhodesia does not say much ,
b02-035-s01-02.png	but it says what is necessary - that
b02-035-s01-03.png	the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
b02-035-s01-04.png	open to revision .
b02-035-s02-00.png	This is news , however
b02-035-s02-01.png	much the Government tries to disguise
b02-035-s02-02.png	it by saying that the revision would be
b02-045-s00-00.png	Formula One , which appeared in February , appeared to make
b02-045-s00-01.png	this likely ; Formula Two , which appeared in June , made it
b02-045-s00-02.png	very unlikely ; if Formula Three restores the original
b02-045-s00-03.png	principle , that is all that need be required of it .
b02-045-s01-00.png	It is a pity
b02-045-s01-01.png	that the Government should ever have been led away
b02-045-s01-02.png	from this principle .
b02-045-s02-00.png	It is a great pity that the
b02-045-s02-01.png	Government should give the appearance of responding , not
b02-045-s02-02.png	to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations , but to
b02-045-s02-03.png	the violence which he tried to prevent .
b02-097-s00-00.png	To be able to say New York next week is an
b02-097-s00-01.png	important advance .
b02-097-s01-00.png	We must not be overconfident
b02-097-s01-01.png	that this # meeting will lead on to further
b02-097-s01-02.png	and decisive ones ; but without it , we could not
b02-097-s01-03.png	look for them .
b02-097-s02-00.png	Federal Germany votes tomorrow
b02-097-s02-01.png	and not a day too soon .
b02-097-s03-00.png	There can seldom have
b02-097-s03-01.png	been an election campaign which more people
b02-097-s03-02.png	in and out of the country wanted to see over
b02-097-s03-03.png	and done with .
b02-102-s00-00.png	To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
b02-102-s00-01.png	millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their
b02-102-s00-02.png	efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with
b02-102-s00-03.png	the Berlin crisis .
b02-102-s01-00.png	It need not have been such a burden
b02-102-s01-01.png	if Western Governments had not been convinced
b02-102-s01-02.png	that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr
b02-102-s01-03.png	Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor .
b02-105-s00-00.png	But they were so convinced and they
b02-105-s00-01.png	have had to take the consequences .
b02-105-s01-00.png	Mean-
b02-105-s01-01.png	while in Germany itself the course of
b02-105-s01-02.png	the campaign has dismayed a good
b02-105-s01-03.png	many people : they too will be glad
b02-105-s01-04.png	when the polling stations close .
b03-025-s00-00.png	But discussion on current points of east-west con-
b03-025-s00-01.png	flict could not go much farther than , for example , the
b03-025-s00-02.png	truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
b03-025-s00-03.png	cannot be followed together .
b03-025-s01-00.png	What the council has done -
b03-025-s01-01.png	and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-
b03-025-s01-02.png	tact across the greatest political barrier in what
b03-025-s01-03.png	is not yet a unitary world .
b03-087-s00-00.png	The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
b03-087-s00-01.png	agreement is signed .
b03-087-s01-00.png	To this there will be some opposition .
b03-087-s02-00.png	The Bill is
b03-087-s02-01.png	short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private
b03-087-s02-02.png	Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps .
b03-087-s03-00.png	This fact may give
b03-087-s03-01.png	the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the
b03-087-s03-02.png	next report from the Molony committee .
b03-092-s00-00.png	Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable .
b03-092-s01-00.png	They should not ,
b03-092-s01-01.png	however , disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of
b03-092-s01-02.png	parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run .
b03-092-s02-00.png	Centigrade v. Fahrenheit .
b03-092-s03-00.png	The fight is on .
b03-092-s04-00.png	The challenger has behind
b03-092-s04-01.png	it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR
b03-092-s04-02.png	but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro-
b03-092-s04-03.png	logical Office .
b03-098-s00-00.png	The press and the broadcasting authorities are
b03-098-s00-01.png	asked to help .
b03-098-s01-00.png	To begin with , both tempe-
b03-098-s01-01.png	ratures will be put in the ring together .
b03-098-s02-00.png	SIR GRAHAM SUTTON , however , made no bones
b03-098-s02-01.png	about it yesterday .
b03-098-s03-00.png	The purpose is to give
b03-098-s03-01.png	fahrenheit the knock out .
b03-098-s04-00.png	The backers of
b03-098-s04-01.png	centigrade would have got off to a better
b03-098-s04-02.png	start if they had taken more pains to
b03-098-s04-03.png	explain the advantages to the general
b03-098-s04-04.png	public of the change .
b03-104-s00-00.png	It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
b03-104-s00-01.png	at the moment an awful mess up in
b03-104-s00-02.png	the measurement of temperatures .
b03-104-s01-00.png	This ,
b03-104-s01-01.png	however , seems a matter of the convenience
b03-104-s01-02.png	of specialists .
b03-104-s02-00.png	The ordinary British man
b03-104-s02-01.png	and woman is conscious of no difficulty .
b03-104-s03-00.png	Rather than fifty million people having
b03-104-s03-01.png	to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there
b03-104-s03-02.png	any reason why the centigrade countries
b03-104-s03-03.png	should not change to fahrenheit ?
b03-109-s00-00.png	Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
b03-109-s00-01.png	strably better than the other ?
b03-109-s01-00.png	The centigraders may
b03-109-s01-01.png	be in for a stiffer fight than they think .
b03-109-s02-00.png	They may
b03-109-s02-01.png	have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market .
b03-109-s03-00.png	Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
b03-109-s03-01.png	public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
b03-109-s03-02.png	circumstances the time would come when this would
b03-109-s03-03.png	suit their convenience - rather than to change their
b03-109-s03-04.png	system of recording temperatures .
b03-114-s00-00.png	In any case , fahrenheit need not lose heart .
b03-114-s01-00.png	Once before , and that not so long ago , the
b03-114-s01-01.png	authorities ganged up to alter the habits
b03-114-s01-02.png	of the people .
b03-114-s02-00.png	That effort was to enforce
b03-114-s02-01.png	the adoption of the twenty-four hour
b03-114-s02-02.png	clock .
b03-114-s03-00.png	Then , also , the B.B.C. were
b03-114-s03-01.png	roped in .
b03-114-s04-00.png	The only result was
b03-114-s04-01.png	that the well-meaning corporation
b03-114-s04-02.png	became very unpopular .
b04-000-s00-00.png	A BAFFLED and bewildered little country
b04-000-s00-01.png	stands at the centre of an international
b04-000-s00-02.png	storm .
b04-000-s01-00.png	Belgium is accused - without a
b04-000-s01-01.png	scrap of evidence - of being implicated in
b04-000-s01-02.png	the murder of Patrice Lumumba .
b04-000-s02-00.png	Her
b04-000-s02-01.png	leaders are insulted , her embassies are
b04-000-s02-02.png	attacked in a score of countries .
b04-004-s00-00.png	In Ghana , President Nkrumah , who
b04-004-s00-01.png	has done more than most to stir up
b04-004-s00-02.png	trouble in the Congo , orders every Belgian
b04-004-s00-03.png	citizen to quit his country .
b04-004-s01-00.png	HOUNDING
b04-004-s01-01.png	Belgium has become an international
b04-004-s01-02.png	pastime .
b04-004-s02-00.png	Why ?
b04-004-s03-00.png	Because those who
b04-004-s03-01.png	said the Congolese could govern themselves
b04-004-s03-02.png	will not admit they were wrong .
b04-004-s04-00.png	So
b04-004-s04-01.png	Belgium , bowed down by internal
b04-004-s04-02.png	troubles , mourning a terrible air crash ,
b04-004-s04-03.png	is made their scapegoat .
b04-010-s00-00.png	Who will speak for Belgium ?
b04-010-s01-00.png	Who else but
b04-010-s01-01.png	Britain .
b04-010-s02-00.png	We have fought beside Belgium
b04-010-s02-01.png	in two world wars .
b04-010-s03-00.png	We are allies still .
b04-010-s04-00.png	Britain should champion Belgium .
b04-010-s05-00.png	Not
b04-010-s05-01.png	with the careful , hooded language of diplomacy ,
b04-010-s05-02.png	but boldly and fearlessly .
b04-010-s06-00.png	It is time to
b04-010-s06-01.png	show the world that this country does not
b04-010-s06-02.png	desert her friends .
b04-010-s07-00.png	HAPPY , happy
b04-010-s07-01.png	families !
b04-010-s08-00.png	Never before have Britain's

b04-020-s00-00.png	Supplies of meat and dairy produce were
b04-020-s00-01.png	substantially higher last year than in 1959 .
b04-020-s01-00.png	Lucky , lucky housewives !
b04-020-s02-00.png	To have such a
b04-020-s02-01.png	splendid variety of goods to choose from .
b04-020-s03-00.png	Not so long ago older folk were reminding

b04-026-s01-01.png	television network , N.B.C.
b04-026-s02-00.png	And hour after hour it poured out its
b04-026-s02-01.png	programmes in bright colours .
b04-026-s03-00.png	In America colour TV is five years
b04-026-s03-01.png	old .
b04-026-s04-00.png	There are already 600,000 sets in use .
b04-026-s05-00.png	What about Britain ?
b04-026-s06-00.png	The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service , but the
b04-026-s06-01.png	commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years .
b04-034-s00-00.png	The Government should settle this argument with two words to
b04-034-s00-01.png	the B.B.C. : -
b04-034-s01-00.png	Go ahead !
b04-034-s02-00.png	ONE man beyond all others is saddened
b04-034-s02-01.png	by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because
b04-034-s02-02.png	they had to leave their cottage .
b04-034-s03-00.png	Mr. John Crabb , clerk to
b04-034-s03-01.png	Newmarket urban council , says :
b04-034-s04-00.png	 I shall always feel this as a
b04-034-s04-01.png	personal failure . 
b04-040-s00-00.png	There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself .
b04-040-s01-00.png	The
b04-040-s01-01.png	sisters had to quit as their home was falling down .
b04-040-s02-00.png	And Mr. Crabb
b04-040-s02-01.png	did his best for them , even driving them to a new house .
b04-040-s03-00.png	John
b04-040-s03-01.png	Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding .
b04-040-s04-00.png	Too
b04-040-s04-01.png	often lacking in officialdom .
b04-040-s05-00.png	MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton
b04-040-s05-01.png	does not want his daughter to marry a Scotsman .
b04-047-s00-00.png	He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to
b04-047-s00-01.png	be in England .
b04-047-s01-00.png	The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a
b04-047-s01-01.png	Scot .
b04-047-s02-00.png	The Lord Chancellor is a Scot .
b04-047-s03-00.png	The Prime Minister is a
b04-047-s03-01.png	Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century .
b04-047-s04-00.png	Let Mr. Newton beware .
b04-047-s05-00.png	By protesting against Scotland he
b04-047-s05-01.png	may be guilty of rebellion !
b04-054-s00-00.png	ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial .
b04-054-s01-00.png	His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
b04-054-s01-01.png	five years .
b04-054-s02-00.png	During this period Britain will be expected
b04-054-s02-01.png	to subsidise and defend the Cypriots .
b04-054-s03-00.png	They will enjoy
b04-054-s03-01.png	all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference .
b04-054-s04-00.png	It is a
b04-054-s04-01.png	safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
b04-054-s04-02.png	company will sign on again .
b04-060-s00-00.png	It is equally certain that the British Government
b04-060-s00-01.png	will welcome them .
b04-060-s01-00.png	How splendid it would be if , just
b04-060-s01-01.png	for once , the Government were to voice the real feelings of
b04-060-s01-02.png	the British people .
b04-060-s02-00.png	And tell Makarios they are not
b04-060-s02-01.png	prepared to accept him on such terms .
b04-060-s03-00.png	GOOD cheer
b04-060-s03-01.png	for the week-end .
b04-060-s04-00.png	Ford Motors are to put 13,000
b04-060-s04-01.png	men back on a five-day week .
b04-066-s00-00.png	One more demonstration of the industry's recovery .
b04-066-s01-00.png	As
b04-066-s01-01.png	springtime approaches , orders pick up .
b04-066-s02-00.png	And the car men get
b04-066-s02-01.png	ready for another bustling season .
b04-066-s03-00.png	The pessimists
b04-066-s03-01.png	said the motor industry was on its knees .
b04-066-s04-00.png	The optimists
b04-066-s04-01.png	said
b04-066-s05-00.png	 Nonsense . 
b04-066-s06-00.png	As usual , the optimists have been
b04-066-s06-01.png	proved right .
b04-066-s07-00.png	EARL RUSSELL and his friends have
b04-066-s07-01.png	hit on an original way of spending this afternoon .
b04-075-s00-00.png	They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence .
b04-075-s01-00.png	It is
b04-075-s01-01.png	their protest against the H-bomb .
b04-075-s02-00.png	They ought to have a
b04-075-s02-01.png	pleasant time .
b04-075-s03-00.png	The weather forecast is good ; except for them ,
b04-075-s03-01.png	Whitehall should be deserted .
b04-075-s04-00.png	And they will have a fine view
b04-075-s04-01.png	of St. James's Park , with its placid lake , pelicans ,
b04-075-s04-02.png	rare ducks , and other wild life .
b04-081-s00-00.png	Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today ?
b04-081-s01-00.png	Head for the parks to enjoy the sun .
b04-081-s02-00.png	Not in
b04-081-s02-01.png	a foolish cause , but in a glorious one .
b04-081-s03-00.png	Good health !
b04-081-s04-00.png	THIS group of men , says a report , work on average
b04-081-s04-01.png	between 55 and 60 hours a week .
b04-081-s05-00.png	They also put
b04-081-s05-01.png	in an extra two or three evenings .
b04-081-s06-00.png	And they never
b04-081-s06-01.png	go on strike .
b04-089-s00-00.png	Who are they ?
b04-089-s01-00.png	The trade union officials of Britain .
b04-089-s02-00.png	Men who earn only a fraction of what their
b04-089-s02-01.png	talents and responsibilities could bring in the open
b04-089-s02-02.png	labour market .
b04-089-s03-00.png	The unions are fortunate indeed to
b04-089-s03-01.png	find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices .
b04-089-s04-00.png	But it is
b04-089-s04-01.png	time the members decided to pay up and be good
b04-089-s04-02.png	employers .
b04-089-s05-00.png	THE Labour Party says that the Tory
b04-089-s05-01.png	Government is destroying the social services .
b04-096-s00-00.png	Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
b04-096-s00-01.png	national income was spent on social services .
b04-096-s01-00.png	The
b04-096-s01-01.png	present figure is 19.5 per cent.
b04-096-s02-00.png	There are many
b04-096-s02-01.png	worthwhile targets for the Opposition .
b04-096-s03-00.png	What a pity
b04-096-s03-01.png	to aim at the wrong one !
b04-096-s04-00.png	MRS. MARCIA POWER ,
b04-096-s04-01.png	whose husband made her clean his uniform , wins
b04-096-s04-02.png	a divorce .
b04-096-s05-00.png	The judge says she had to act almost
b04-096-s05-01.png	as a serf .
b04-103-s00-00.png	Up and down the country husbands will be saying
b04-103-s00-01.png	they would never behave like that .
b04-103-s01-00.png	But do they ever
b04-103-s01-01.png	ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
b04-103-s01-02.png	returned to the shed ; their books tidied ; and often ,
b04-103-s01-03.png	even their shoes cleaned ?
b04-103-s02-00.png	How wonderful if they
b04-103-s02-01.png	showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise
b04-103-s02-02.png	box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers !
b04-107-s00-00.png	HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly
b04-107-s00-01.png	in Rhodesia !
b04-107-s01-00.png	Eighteen months ago this territory
b04-107-s01-01.png	was peaceful , orderly , and thriving .
b04-107-s02-00.png	Africans within the
b04-107-s02-01.png	Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
b04-107-s02-02.png	administration .
b04-107-s03-00.png	Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
b04-107-s03-01.png	Secretary .
b04-107-s04-00.png	Suddenly everything changed .
b04-107-s05-00.png	Timetables were
b04-107-s05-01.png	scrapped .
b04-107-s06-00.png	The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
b04-107-s06-01.png	rushed out to Rhodesia .
b04-107-s07-00.png	Overnight , minor African
b04-107-s07-01.png	politicians were inflated into international figures .
b04-116-s00-00.png	And as the British Government stepped up the pace
b04-116-s00-01.png	of change , so the Africans stepped up their demands .
b04-116-s01-00.png	TODAY , in London , that rash and thoughtless policy has
b04-116-s01-01.png	caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened .
b04-116-s02-00.png	No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching .
b04-116-s03-00.png	If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
b04-116-s03-01.png	Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
b04-116-s03-02.png	difficulties from African politicians greedy for power .
b04-121-s00-00.png	But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
b04-121-s00-01.png	be plunged into chaos , like the Congo .
b04-121-s01-00.png	For Mr.
b04-121-s01-01.png	Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice .
b04-121-s02-00.png	They
b04-121-s02-01.png	must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos .
b04-121-s03-00.png	And try to
b04-121-s03-01.png	repair the damage they have done .
b04-121-s04-00.png	WHO can grow the
b04-121-s04-01.png	fastest ?
b04-121-s05-00.png	That is the exciting competition going on
b04-121-s05-01.png	among Britain's major industries .
b04-128-s00-00.png	Top of the table , at the moment , is the chemical industry .
b04-128-s01-00.png	Then comes engineering , followed by iron and steel .
b04-128-s02-00.png	Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
b04-128-s02-01.png	tremendous upsurge in investment .
b04-128-s03-00.png	It reports that new
b04-128-s03-01.png	factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
b04-128-s03-02.png	up on 1960 .
b04-128-s04-00.png	Britain's business men are right to back
b04-128-s04-01.png	their faith with cash .
b04-134-s00-00.png	For expansion today means still greater
b04-134-s00-01.png	prosperity tomorrow .
b04-134-s01-00.png	BERTRAND RUSSELL ,
b04-134-s01-01.png	the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
b04-134-s01-02.png	the-Bomb crusade , has devoted following .
b04-134-s02-00.png	Thousands march with him - and sit with him
b04-134-s02-01.png	too .
b04-134-s03-00.png	It is said by some that he is a saint ; by
b04-134-s03-01.png	others that he is a prophet .
b04-134-s04-00.png	He is , in fact , a
b04-134-s04-01.png	philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
b04-134-s04-02.png	who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
b04-134-s04-03.png	issues of our time .
b04-140-s00-00.png	BEFORE the war he urged the British people
b04-140-s00-01.png	to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists .
b04-140-s01-00.png	After the war he favoured a preventive war against
b04-140-s01-01.png	Russia .
b04-140-s02-00.png	Now he wants Britain to demolish her
b04-140-s02-01.png	defences .
b04-140-s03-00.png	Throughout the years Lord Russell
b04-140-s03-01.png	and his supporters have been able to pursue their
b04-140-s03-02.png	eccentric campaigns in freedom .
b04-140-s04-00.png	They should
b04-140-s04-01.png	ask themselves this question :
b04-140-s05-00.png	How long would
b04-140-s05-01.png	that freedom last if their policies were adopted ?
b04-147-s00-00.png	AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity
b04-147-s00-01.png	Board .
b04-147-s01-00.png	The board is laying a cable along a seven-
b04-147-s01-01.png	mile route in Surrey .
b04-147-s02-00.png	A warden , Mr. Jack Finlay ,
b04-147-s02-01.png	has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for
b04-147-s02-02.png	householders when trenches are dug outside their
b04-147-s02-03.png	front gates .
b04-147-s03-00.png	Splendid .
b04-147-s04-00.png	By showing concern
b04-147-s04-01.png	for the people the board will earn their good will .
b04-147-s05-00.png	Happy patrolling , Mr. Finlay !
b04-154-s00-00.png	GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky !
b04-154-s01-00.png	The tough ,
b04-154-s01-01.png	resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
b04-154-s01-02.png	shakes the life out of his critics .
b04-154-s02-00.png	He calls them
b04-154-s02-01.png	 jelly-boned . 
b04-154-s03-00.png	He promises to preserve federation
b04-154-s03-01.png	against African fanatics and woolly minded
b04-154-s03-02.png	individuals in the West .
b04-154-s04-00.png	Some may ask :
b04-154-s05-00.png	Is
b04-154-s05-01.png	Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
b04-154-s05-02.png	disagree with him ?
b04-154-s06-00.png	The facts answer that .
b04-162-s00-00.png	CONTRAST his firm , successful rule in Rhodesia
b04-162-s00-01.png	with what has happened in the Congo .
b04-162-s01-00.png	There
b04-162-s01-01.png	Welensky's opponents have carried their theories
b04-162-s01-02.png	into practice .
b04-162-s02-00.png	There a UNO army of Africans ,
b04-162-s02-01.png	bossed by an Indian , has been in charge for
b04-162-s02-02.png	months .
b04-162-s03-00.png	And what has it made of the Congo ?
b04-162-s04-00.png	A bloodstained shambles .
b04-162-s05-00.png	No wonder
b04-162-s05-01.png	Welensky has lost all patience with his
b04-162-s05-02.png	misguided tormentors .
b04-169-s00-00.png	They have earned his strictures .
b04-169-s01-00.png	And his
b04-169-s01-01.png	contempt .
b04-169-s02-00.png	SOME people are for ever complaining
b04-169-s02-01.png	that teenagers earn too much and spend it all
b04-169-s02-02.png	when they get it .
b04-169-s03-00.png	Now a survey of the Post
b04-169-s03-01.png	Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that
b04-169-s03-02.png	idea is .
b04-169-s04-00.png	The biggest group of depositors in
b04-169-s04-01.png	the bank is made of boys and girls aged 15
b04-169-s04-02.png	to 19 .
b04-175-s00-00.png	Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before .
b04-175-s01-00.png	Certainly they spend more .
b04-175-s02-00.png	But how splendid
b04-175-s02-01.png	that in the most prosperous days in this
b04-175-s02-02.png	country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift
b04-175-s02-03.png	should still have a powerful appeal for young
b04-175-s02-04.png	people .
b04-175-s03-00.png	THE Danes are annoyed with British
b04-175-s03-01.png	farmers for fighting against Danish competition .
b04-175-s04-00.png	They say that our farmers do not seem to
b04-175-s04-01.png	understand the meaning of free trade .
b04-181-s00-00.png	There is no doubt what the Danes understand
b04-181-s00-01.png	by free trade .
b04-181-s01-00.png	It is that they should be free
b04-181-s01-01.png	to sell as much as they like , while buying
b04-181-s01-02.png	more and more from our rivals .
b04-181-s02-00.png	Germany has
b04-181-s02-01.png	now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
b04-181-s02-02.png	principal supplier .
b04-181-s03-00.png	The farmers of Britain
b04-181-s03-01.png	understand free trade .
b04-181-s04-00.png	That is why they fight
b04-181-s04-01.png	it .
b04-187-s00-00.png	THE Palace cinema at Buckley , near Chester , will be
b04-187-s00-01.png	reopened next week by Barry Flanagan and Eric
b04-187-s00-02.png	Platt , both aged 19 .
b04-187-s01-00.png	Eric says :
b04-187-s02-00.png	 We believe in the
b04-187-s02-01.png	cinema .
b04-187-s03-00.png	And we know what people want . 
b04-187-s04-00.png	The
b04-187-s04-01.png	combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation
b04-187-s04-02.png	of public taste has launched many great
b04-187-s04-03.png	enterprises .
b04-187-s05-00.png	Barry and Eric have enthusiasm .
b04-187-s06-00.png	They
b04-187-s06-01.png	are backed by a resurgent film industry .
b04-195-s00-00.png	It could be curtain up on two success stories .
b04-195-s01-00.png	Of
b04-195-s01-01.png	the old Palace .
b04-195-s02-00.png	And Barry and Eric .
b04-195-s03-00.png	DONS at
b04-195-s03-01.png	Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become
b04-195-s03-02.png	an honours degree course .
b04-195-s04-00.png	Farming is Britain's
b04-195-s04-01.png	most vital industry .
b04-195-s05-00.png	It is increasingly dependent
b04-195-s05-01.png	on new techniques - and on the universities to
b04-195-s05-02.png	provide men of knowledge and skill .
b04-202-s00-00.png	The older universities are often accused of being
b04-202-s00-01.png	interested only in dead subjects .
b04-202-s01-00.png	Now Cambridge has
b04-202-s01-01.png	the opportunity to show is just as interested in the
b04-202-s01-02.png	living .
b04-202-s02-00.png	Particularly as its rival , Oxford , has had a
b04-202-s02-01.png	similar course in farming for 15 years !

b04-202-s04-00.png	One of
b04-202-s04-01.png	these three men has a date with destiny - the
b04-202-s04-02.png	first journey into Space .
b04-208-s00-00.png	At the beginning of this wonderful century many
b04-208-s00-01.png	people believed that there were no more worlds to
b04-208-s00-02.png	conquer .
b05-017-s00-00.png	Nobody 's going to shove 2ole Uncle Sam around ! 
b05-017-s01-00.png	He then
b05-017-s01-01.png	took out a piece of paper , wrote his address on it and added :
b05-017-s02-00.png	 Anybody mucking the Yanks about had better call on me
b05-017-s02-01.png	first .
b05-017-s03-00.png	I won't stand for it . 
b05-017-s04-00.png	Exit a puzzled American .
b05-017-s05-00.png	The other incident occurred in the boat-train from Cherbourg
b05-017-s05-01.png	to Paris .
b05-032-s00-00.png	The travellers from the New World who had
b05-032-s00-01.png	been in Britain many times before , were
b05-032-s00-02.png	slightly stunned .
b05-032-s01-00.png	Afterwards they said :
b05-032-s02-00.png	 We thought
b05-032-s02-01.png	we knew it all , but you Britishers never run
b05-032-s02-02.png	out of unturned stones . 
b05-032-s03-00.png	To the British Travel Association , doing their excellent
b05-032-s03-01.png	darndest , I offer these sad complexities .
b05-032-s04-00.png	IN the 1830's
b05-032-s04-01.png	the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
b05-032-s04-02.png	many a good trade unionist since then has , in the
b05-032-s04-03.png	hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers , taken
b05-032-s04-04.png	the theoretical Luddite hammer again .
b05-038-s00-00.png	Hence the hostility to automation and
b05-038-s00-01.png	the stop-watch manufacturing methods that
b05-038-s00-02.png	have # led to restrictive practices .
b05-038-s01-00.png	Now a new
b05-038-s01-01.png	threat to those who toil and spin has been
b05-038-s01-02.png	developed by a firm specialising in electronics
b05-038-s01-03.png	in Los Angeles .
b05-038-s02-00.png	They have developed a new
b05-038-s02-01.png	system whereby completely untrained workers
b05-038-s02-02.png	can be taught their trade by means of tape
b05-038-s02-03.png	recordings and television .
b05-042-s00-00.png	What happens is that the unskilled worker
b05-042-s00-01.png	is processed , by high-speed listening to recorded
b05-042-s00-02.png	instructions on how to do the job coupled with
b05-042-s00-03.png	explanatory TV pictures , into becoming a highly
b05-042-s00-04.png	skilled , obedient craftsman in no time at all .
b05-042-s01-00.png	Not only can the raw human mind be
b05-042-s01-01.png	technically equipped very quickly to do one
b05-042-s01-02.png	set of skilled manufacturing processes in one
b05-042-s01-03.png	trade but , by being given another of the new
b05-042-s01-04.png	audio-TV training techniques , he can be switched
b05-042-s01-05.png	to a different industry if he just gives in and
b05-045-s00-00.png	From being an assembler in an aircraft
b05-045-s00-01.png	factory to becoming a paint sprayer in
b05-045-s00-02.png	a ceramic factory , he can be qualified
b05-045-s00-03.png	for a completely new job in less time
b05-045-s00-04.png	than it takes to say
b05-045-s01-00.png	 Tolpuddle
b05-045-s01-01.png	Martyrs ! 
b05-045-s02-00.png	 CRICKET , says the Oxford
b05-045-s02-01.png	Dictionary , is an open air game played
b05-045-s02-02.png	with ball , bats and wickets between
b05-045-s02-03.png	# two sides consisting of eleven players
b05-045-s02-04.png	each . 
b05-045-s03-00.png	Not so , dear Oxford Dictionary .
b05-050-s00-00.png	You are out of date .
b05-050-s01-00.png	Cricket in 1961 is played
b05-050-s01-01.png	with a theodolite , six surveyors , a ball ;
b05-050-s01-02.png	bats and wickets between two sides .
b05-050-s02-00.png	Shades
b05-050-s02-01.png	of the village stalwarts of Hambledon who
b05-050-s02-02.png	are now the patron saints of the game !
b05-050-s03-00.png	What would THEY have thought of
b05-050-s03-01.png	these civil engineers creeping about
b05-050-s03-02.png	the pitch with their optical
b05-050-s03-03.png	instruments ?
b05-055-s00-00.png	The village green is the real home of cricket .
b05-055-s01-00.png	A couple of bumps
b05-055-s01-01.png	on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman with a stout
b05-055-s01-02.png	heart , a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for
b05-055-s01-03.png	batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a
b05-055-s01-04.png	mighty six these days as rare as frostbite in summer .
b05-058-s00-00.png	They 'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next .
b05-058-s01-00.png	EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the
b05-058-s01-01.png	German mind .
b05-058-s02-00.png	Not content with arguing that he was only an
b05-058-s02-01.png	efficient cog in the machine , he now claims that part of the
b05-058-s02-02.png	endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was
b05-058-s02-03.png	 decent , feasible and workable . 
b05-062-s00-00.png	He feels satisfaction from the fact that my personality had been
b05-062-s00-01.png	tested and weighed and not found wanting . 
b05-062-s01-00.png	He feels like
b05-062-s01-01.png	Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude
b05-062-s01-02.png	saying :
b05-062-s02-00.png	 I am innocent of the blood of this just person . 
b05-062-s03-00.png	Like Dr. Globke , whom I interviewed the other day , Eichmann
b05-062-s03-01.png	said :
b05-067-s00-00.png	 I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I
b05-067-s00-01.png	could despite my low rank . 
b05-067-s01-00.png	Eichmann is on dangerous ground
b05-067-s01-01.png	when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base
b05-067-s01-02.png	of the triangle that led to Hitler , Himmler , Hess and Goering
b05-067-s01-03.png	at the apex .
b05-067-s02-00.png	In examination he betrayed an expert and
b05-067-s02-01.png	intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that
b05-067-s02-02.png	led to the top .
b05-071-s00-00.png	He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and
b05-071-s00-01.png	meticulous comprehension that could only have come from a man
b05-071-s00-02.png	who used the system - and used it with power and authority .
b05-071-s01-00.png	The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them-
b05-071-s01-01.png	selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are
b05-071-s01-02.png	red with blood .
b05-074-s00-00.png	They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles
b05-074-s00-01.png	was an iniquitous injustice .
b05-074-s01-00.png	When they burst into
b05-074-s01-01.png	Czechoslovakia , Poland , Holland , Belgium and France
b05-074-s01-02.png	they really believed Hitler when he screamed at
b05-074-s01-03.png	them that they were being encircled . 
b05-074-s02-00.png	They really
b05-074-s02-01.png	believed in the moral superiority of The New
b05-074-s02-02.png	Order which Himmler on October 4 , 1943 , expressed
b05-074-s02-03.png	thus :
b05-074-s03-00.png	 Whether nations live in prosperity or starve
b05-074-s03-01.png	to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we
b05-074-s03-02.png	need them as slaves to # our Kultur ; otherwise
b05-074-s03-03.png	it is of no interest to me .
b05-079-s00-00.png	This concept of slavery included Britain .
b05-079-s01-00.png	General Brauchitsch signed a directive
b05-079-s01-01.png	ordering that after the successful
b05-079-s01-02.png	invasion of our islands all the able-bodied
b05-079-s01-03.png	male population between the ages of
b05-079-s01-04.png	seventeen and forty-five will , unless the
b05-079-s01-05.png	local situation calls for an exceptional
b05-079-s01-06.png	ruling , be interned and dispatched to the
b05-079-s01-07.png	Continent . 
b05-079-s02-00.png	The Baltic States were
b05-079-s02-01.png	to have been our destination .
b05-083-s00-00.png	In no other conquered country , not even
b05-083-s00-01.png	Poland , had the Germans begun with such a
b05-083-s00-02.png	drastic step .
b05-083-s01-00.png	There is no doubt that the compatriots
b05-083-s01-01.png	of Eichmann would have been as good as their
b05-083-s01-02.png	evil word .
b05-083-s02-00.png	THE Inland Revenue people have a
b05-083-s02-01.png	thankless task .
b05-083-s03-00.png	But they do not make
b05-083-s03-01.png	themselves less disliked by their attitude
b05-083-s03-02.png	to their customers - who incidentally
b05-083-s03-03.png	pay their salaries .
b05-088-s00-00.png	Their demands are invariably couched in
b05-088-s00-01.png	hectoring , out-of-date language , but in spite of all
b05-088-s00-02.png	their bluster , they let many a big fish through the
b05-088-s00-03.png	net while they are bullying the minnows .
b05-088-s01-00.png	I have just
b05-088-s01-01.png	heard a good example of their officious efficiency .
b05-088-s02-00.png	A young chap I know got his first job last week .
b05-088-s03-00.png	He
b05-088-s03-01.png	is paid monthly in arrears and will not get
b05-088-s03-02.png	a bean for the next twenty-one days .
b05-098-s00-00.png	It was called Abou Ben Adhem and the
b05-098-s00-01.png	Angel . 
b05-098-s01-00.png	I don't know why I was so
b05-098-s01-01.png	impressed with this poem but , on re-
b05-098-s01-02.png	flection , it might be that I took a
b05-098-s01-03.png	guilty interest in the devilment busi-
b05-098-s01-04.png	ness .
b05-098-s02-00.png	I may well have felt that I was
b05-098-s02-01.png	hell-bound under a strict Presbyterian
b05-098-s02-02.png	upbringing and a possible reprieve might
b05-098-s02-03.png	come through the sugary sentiments
b05-098-s02-04.png	of Abou Ben Adhem . 
b06-000-s00-00.png	SOME 17 years ago , in the early summer of 1934 ,
b06-000-s00-01.png	the German ambassador in London was dictating
b06-000-s00-02.png	a secret report to his chief von Papen , in Berlin .
b06-000-s01-00.png	 Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion
b06-000-s01-01.png	of German rearmament , in opposition , to France . 
b06-000-s02-00.png	Later that year he warned that Britain knew
b06-000-s02-01.png	Germany was breaking the agreement to stop
b06-000-s02-02.png	building bombers , and added :
b06-004-s00-00.png	 Without Britain's tolerance German rearma-
b06-004-s00-01.png	ment in the air would be jeopardised . 
b06-004-s01-00.png	When
b06-004-s01-01.png	Hoesch's reports , along with other nazi documents ,
b06-004-s01-02.png	were captured and published after the war the
b06-004-s01-03.png	pattern of British Government connivance became
b06-004-s01-04.png	clear .
b06-004-s02-00.png	At nazi Germany's request , Britain was
b06-004-s02-01.png	providing the cloak for Germany to build an
b06-004-s02-02.png	air force bigger than that of France .
b06-008-s00-00.png	Yesterday West German Defence Minister ,
b06-008-s00-01.png	Herr Strauss , started talks with the British
b06-008-s00-02.png	Defence Minister , Mr. Watkinson .
b06-008-s01-00.png	Their talks
b06-008-s01-01.png	are another stage in the cloak operation ,
b06-008-s01-02.png	1961 variety , by which the West German
b06-008-s01-03.png	militarists are advancing their rearmament .
b06-008-s02-00.png	Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October
b06-008-s02-01.png	that his policy was to make his country
b06-008-s02-02.png	the strongest militarily in Europe and the
b06-008-s02-03.png	United States' principal Nato ally . 
b06-012-s00-00.png	His job is to build up the military apparatus which
b06-012-s00-01.png	will back West Germany's economic domination of Western
b06-012-s00-02.png	Europe through the Common Market .
b06-012-s01-00.png	He continued this week
b06-012-s01-01.png	the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he had in public at a
b06-012-s01-02.png	Nato council meeting last year over the question : do we
b06-012-s01-03.png	fight a 30-day war or a 90-day war ?
b06-015-s00-00.png	A 90-day war , the West German
b06-015-s00-01.png	view , provides the pretext for huge
b06-015-s00-02.png	German armed forces ( within Nato
b06-015-s00-03.png	of course ) and for those to have
b06-015-s00-04.png	bases all over Western Europe .
b06-015-s01-00.png	In the past year West Germany
b06-015-s01-01.png	has secured agreements for
b06-015-s01-02.png	 facilities in France , Holland and
b06-015-s01-03.png	Belgium .
b06-015-s02-00.png	After much bargaining
b06-015-s02-01.png	the British Government has
b06-015-s02-02.png	agreed to give similar facilities 
b06-019-s00-00.png	The process has been too slow for Herr
b06-019-s00-01.png	Strauss and last month he attacked
b06-019-s00-02.png	Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's
b06-019-s00-03.png	plans for a unified supply apparatus 
b06-019-s00-04.png	in Nato .
b06-019-s01-00.png	( A supply apparatus which would
b06-019-s01-01.png	link together the various West German
b06-019-s01-02.png	 facilities . )
b06-019-s02-00.png	By the end of the year there
b06-019-s02-01.png	will be 11 German divisions in Nato
b06-019-s02-02.png	compared with four divisions of
b06-019-s02-03.png	British troops .
b06-023-s00-00.png	Alongside these divisions a force of over 600
b06-023-s00-01.png	Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing
b06-023-s00-02.png	up .
b06-023-s01-00.png	These fighters are in fact fighter bombers
b06-023-s01-01.png	which could launch an atomic attack on
b06-023-s01-02.png	Eastern Europe .
b06-023-s02-00.png	By 1963 the Germans plan to have
b06-023-s02-01.png	nine missile battalions , with 288 missiles and
b06-023-s02-02.png	36 firing ramps , including weapons like Matador
b06-023-s02-03.png	( range 950 miles ) , also provided by the Americans .
b06-027-s00-00.png	Last month West Germany was
b06-027-s00-01.png	reported to be halfway toward
b06-027-s00-02.png	this target .
b06-027-s01-00.png	Her position as America's
b06-027-s01-01.png	principal Nato ally grows stronger
b06-027-s01-02.png	and stronger .
b06-027-s02-00.png	Now this target which
b06-027-s02-01.png	Herr Strauss and his fellows
b06-027-s02-02.png	have their eyes on is control of the
b06-027-s02-03.png	warheads to these weapons .
b06-027-s03-00.png	General
b06-027-s03-01.png	Heusinger , the man who caused
b06-027-s03-02.png	a great disturbance last autumn
b06-032-s00-00.png	All this has been achieved through Nato under
b06-032-s00-01.png	American leadership .
b06-032-s01-00.png	But a big role has been
b06-032-s01-01.png	played not only by the British Government but
b06-032-s01-02.png	by Right-Wing Labour in this country .
b06-032-s02-00.png	They have
b06-032-s02-01.png	helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany ,
b06-032-s02-02.png	in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet
b06-032-s02-03.png	policy which brought disaster in 1939 .
b06-036-s00-00.png	Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained
b06-036-s00-01.png	and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in
b06-036-s00-02.png	control .
b06-036-s01-00.png	Nato , far from being a means of controlling
b06-036-s01-01.png	the German militarists , is , in fact , the cover for
b06-036-s01-02.png	building up their power .
b06-036-s02-00.png	What must Britain do ?
b06-036-s03-00.png	Today ,
b06-036-s03-01.png	again , she has a key role .
b06-036-s04-00.png	Let her tell men like Strauss
b06-036-s04-01.png	that he shall have no bases or facilities , no help in
b06-036-s04-02.png	his quest for atomic arms .
b06-042-s00-00.png	A policy which breaks with military
b06-042-s00-01.png	alliances like Nato and seeks friendship
b06-042-s00-02.png	with the Soviet Union can prevent another
b06-042-s00-03.png	betrayal like that of the '30s . Shipbuilding
b06-042-s01-00.png	Draughtsmen , writing in his personal capa-
b06-042-s01-01.png	city : * # I WAS pleased to read J. R. Camp-
b06-042-s01-02.png	bell's article , for , as president of a union
b06-042-s01-03.png	which fought for and still stands on the
b06-042-s01-04.png	policy decisions established at the Scar-
b06-042-s01-05.png	borough Labour Party Conference I am
b06-042-s01-06.png	appalled at the character of the current
b06-045-s00-00.png	For many years my union had to present its views
b06-045-s00-01.png	to the two major conferences of the movement and
b06-045-s00-02.png	take a licking .
b06-045-s01-00.png	For us , unity meant accepting
b06-045-s01-01.png	unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the
b06-045-s01-02.png	movement and having a go next time .
b06-045-s02-00.png	Alongside
b06-045-s02-01.png	many others , we conducted our fight by putting
b06-045-s02-02.png	down # unambiguous alternatives to
b06-045-s02-03.png	official policy and seeking to win majorities
b06-045-s02-04.png	for them .
b06-049-s00-00.png	When Scarborough carried our point of view
b06-049-s00-01.png	we were naturally delighted , more so because
b06-049-s00-02.png	the alternatives had been put clearly to the
b06-049-s00-03.png	movement , which had then chosen a vigorous
b06-049-s00-04.png	anti-Nato , anti-Tory , anti-bomb and anti-German
b06-049-s00-05.png	rearmament policy .
b06-049-s01-00.png	Hopes rose as we saw a
b06-049-s01-01.png	perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent
b06-049-s01-02.png	lines of difference with the Tories .
b06-049-s02-00.png	Many members
b06-049-s02-01.png	understood that the bread-and-butter struggles
b06-049-s02-02.png	of the union would become easier in the context
b06-053-s00-00.png	For we have always felt , even
b06-053-s00-01.png	if we have then by our practice
b06-053-s00-02.png	ignored it , the inconsistency
b06-053-s00-03.png	between support for the war
b06-053-s00-04.png	alliance , with resulting colossal
b06-053-s00-05.png	spending on armaments , and our
b06-053-s00-06.png	basic effort to improve living
b06-053-s00-07.png	standards .
b06-053-s01-00.png	Instead , we saw the
b06-053-s01-01.png	Gaitskellites using the position
b06-053-s01-02.png	of organisational dominance
b06-053-s01-03.png	established during their years
b06-056-s00-00.png	They obstructed every effort to fight for the
b06-056-s00-01.png	Scarborough decisions , while # scratching
b06-056-s00-02.png	around frantically to overturn them next
b06-056-s00-03.png	time .
b06-056-s01-00.png	Confusion of the original issue
b06-056-s01-01.png	by misrepresentation of the decisions ,
b06-056-s01-02.png	the introduction of a pseudo third way
b06-056-s01-03.png	and the call for party unity - in effect ,
b06-056-s01-04.png	a demand that the movement unite
b06-056-s01-05.png	with the Gaitskellites on their policy
b06-056-s01-06.png	and no other seems to have done the
b06-056-s01-07.png	trick of moving a number of unions
b06-059-s00-00.png	It would become easy to become cynical and
b06-059-s00-01.png	to despair .
b06-059-s01-00.png	And yet , wherever the issues were put
b06-059-s01-01.png	clearly , sections of the movement reaffirmed their
b06-059-s01-02.png	original stand .
b06-059-s02-00.png	Only where the issues were
b06-059-s02-01.png	posed so as to cause doubt and confusion
b06-059-s02-02.png	were positions lost .
b06-059-s03-00.png	It is my view that this
b06-059-s03-01.png	immediate confusion hides the fact that the
b06-059-s03-02.png	Peace movement is still advancing and that
b06-059-s03-03.png	clarification of the issues can bring a
b06-059-s03-04.png	majority to # secure the Scarborough
b06-059-s03-05.png	decisions .
b06-064-s00-00.png	Powerful units have stood firm .
b06-064-s01-00.png	In unions where the central issues
b06-064-s01-01.png	were confused , clear policy details -
b06-064-s01-02.png	as on bases - were decisively carried .
b06-064-s02-00.png	This , and the numbers of active
b06-064-s02-01.png	workers who are beginning to understand
b06-064-s02-02.png	how and why the trick was done ,
b06-064-s02-03.png	provides a strong , immediate basis
b06-064-s02-04.png	for a campaign against weak and
b06-064-s02-05.png	doubtful positions , and for a consistent
b06-064-s02-06.png	peace policy .
b06-068-s00-00.png	All recent events show how correct the
b06-068-s00-01.png	Scarborough decisions were .
b06-068-s01-00.png	The Kennedy
b06-068-s01-01.png	Administration's sharpened policies , the
b06-068-s01-02.png	speeded-up drive to improve West
b06-068-s01-03.png	Germany's armament , the new attempt
b06-068-s01-04.png	to rush Britain into the European Common
b06-068-s01-05.png	Market , and the kite-flying on Spain
b06-068-s01-06.png	present a whole new proof that to abandon
b06-068-s01-07.png	Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
b06-068-s01-08.png	working class to sharp new dangers - that
b06-068-s01-09.png	Gaitskellism is bankrupt .
b06-071-s00-00.png	Ordinary working people will never
b06-071-s00-01.png	rally to defend a policy founded on
b06-071-s00-02.png	political chicanery or elect a Labour
b06-071-s00-03.png	Government to carry through Tory policy -
b06-071-s00-04.png	Gaitskell's stupid hope .
b06-071-s01-00.png	The tragedy is
b06-071-s01-01.png	that enormous inroads could already
b06-071-s01-02.png	have been made into Tory strength by
b06-071-s01-03.png	a fighting policy , based on Scarborough .
b06-071-s02-00.png	THE desire for unity in the Labour and
b06-071-s02-01.png	trade union movement following the
b06-075-s00-00.png	At the same time that unity cannot be
b06-075-s00-01.png	established on a false basis , or by creating
b06-075-s00-02.png	further confusion within the movement .
b06-075-s01-00.png	Unity
b06-075-s01-01.png	will never be established on the basis of leaders
b06-075-s01-02.png	being a law unto themselves and opposing
b06-075-s01-03.png	conference decisions when it suits their own
b06-075-s01-04.png	convenience .
b06-075-s02-00.png	Unity can never be established by
b06-075-s02-01.png	any formula uniting those who oppose German
b06-075-s02-02.png	troops being trained on British soil and Polaris ,
b06-075-s02-03.png	and those who are for this policy - which is the
b06-075-s02-04.png	same as that of the Tory Government .
b06-079-s00-00.png	It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state-
b06-079-s00-01.png	ment to unite the movement as the Labour
b06-079-s00-02.png	leaders are not only in favour of American
b06-079-s00-03.png	bases , but are in favour of German bases and
b06-079-s00-04.png	troops being trained on British soil .
b06-079-s01-00.png	The new
b06-079-s01-01.png	Defence statement , while accepting that Britain can-
b06-079-s01-02.png	not remain an independent nuclear Power , now
b06-079-s01-03.png	supports the policy of depending on American
b06-079-s01-04.png	nuclear weapons and the H-bomb , placing
b06-079-s01-05.png	Britain in an even more dangerous position .
b06-082-s00-00.png	The statement of Padley and Crossman is no
b06-082-s00-01.png	different in principle to the new defence statement .
b06-082-s01-00.png	They accept American nuclear bases , and also
b06-082-s01-01.png	the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy
b06-082-s01-02.png	until some future date .
b06-082-s02-00.png	They deceive the people
b06-082-s02-01.png	by their talk of political and collective control
b06-082-s02-02.png	of Nato .
b06-082-s03-00.png	The Pentagon has made it perfectly
b06-082-s03-01.png	clear who controls the American H-bomb , and
b06-082-s03-02.png	who will actually give the instructions to press
b06-082-s03-03.png	the button for nuclear warfare .
b06-087-s00-00.png	There is only one way to develop unity and
b06-087-s00-01.png	at the same time defend Britain .
b06-087-s01-00.png	This
b06-087-s01-01.png	was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
b06-087-s01-02.png	Congress , representing 800,000 organised
b06-087-s01-03.png	trade unionists , when it decided by overwhelming
b06-087-s01-04.png	votes , to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions
b06-087-s01-05.png	on unilateral disarmament , and to oppose
b06-087-s01-06.png	Polaris and military bases being installed on
b06-087-s01-07.png	the Holy Loch , or any other part of Britain .
b06-090-s00-00.png	Such a policy would unite the whole movement
b06-090-s00-01.png	and lay the basis for the defeat of the
b06-090-s00-02.png	present Tory Government , which has become a
b06-090-s00-03.png	real menace to the British people both in
b06-090-s00-04.png	home and foreign policy .
b06-090-s01-00.png	It is quite evident
b06-090-s01-01.png	that the movement will go on record against
b06-090-s01-02.png	the Polaris base and facilities for German bases
b06-090-s01-03.png	and military training .
b06-093-s00-00.png	This should strengthen the campaign to
b06-093-s00-01.png	end the manufacture and use of
b06-093-s00-02.png	nuclear weapons in Britain .
b06-093-s01-00.png	Britain then
b06-093-s01-01.png	could play a leading and independent
b06-093-s01-02.png	role for an international agreement to ban
b06-093-s01-03.png	all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass
b06-093-s01-04.png	destruction , and lay the basis for real
b06-093-s01-05.png	peace and progress .
b06-093-s02-00.png	WHEN all the
b06-093-s02-01.png	ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training
b06-093-s02-02.png	Week subsides it is doubtful whether more
b06-093-s02-03.png	than a handful of new apprenticeships
b06-097-s00-00.png	This week of window dressing will not prevent
b06-097-s00-01.png	most of the hopeful 15-year-olds leaving school
b06-097-s00-02.png	in six weeks time from ending up in blind alley
b06-097-s00-03.png	jobs .
b06-097-s01-00.png	It needs more than 10,000 church parades
b06-097-s01-01.png	and open days at techs , more than descents into
b06-097-s01-02.png	Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over
b06-097-s01-03.png	Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to
b06-097-s01-04.png	catch up with the space age .
b06-100-s00-00.png	The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh ,
b06-100-s00-01.png	opening a few technical college extensions ,
b06-100-s00-02.png	will not keep us abreast of the
b06-100-s00-03.png	scientific revolution .
b06-100-s01-00.png	Out of the 550,000
b06-100-s01-01.png	young people aged 15-17 starting
b06-100-s01-02.png	work in 1960 420000 ( 73 per cent )
b06-100-s01-03.png	went into unskilled work .
b06-100-s02-00.png	The per-
b06-100-s02-01.png	centage is expected to swell to 80
b06-100-s02-02.png	next year .
b06-100-s03-00.png	The Duke , possibly
b06-100-s03-01.png	speaking from experience , stated :
b06-110-s00-00.png	But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people
b06-110-s00-01.png	prefer unskilled jobs .
b06-110-s01-00.png	Countless numbers who want training
b06-110-s01-01.png	are denied it .
b06-110-s02-00.png	One area electricity board in 1958
b06-110-s02-01.png	offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
b06-110-s02-02.png	applications , of whom 100 were considered suitable by
b06-110-s02-03.png	the board .
b06-110-s03-00.png	There were only 17 vacancies for the 58
b06-110-s03-01.png	boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth
b06-110-s03-02.png	dockyard last year .
c01-009-s00-00.png	The production by Bill Duncalf
c01-009-s00-01.png	compressed a long and sometimes rambling
c01-009-s00-02.png	story into a concentrated comprehensive
c01-009-s00-03.png	survey of a life work .
c01-009-s01-00.png	P. J. K.
c01-009-s02-00.png	HANS WERNER
c01-009-s02-01.png	HENZE'S Elegy for Young Lovers is the first
c01-009-s02-02.png	unambiguously contemporary work to be
c01-009-s02-03.png	admitted to the Glyndebourne canon .
c01-009-s03-00.png	By no
c01-009-s03-01.png	means a masterpiece , it is in many respects
c01-009-s03-02.png	a representative modern work and the composer
c01-009-s03-03.png	is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary
c01-009-s03-04.png	idioms , with a strong sense of words and situation .
c01-014-s00-00.png	The libretto , by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman ,
c01-014-s00-01.png	is largely a satire on the petty court
c01-014-s00-02.png	surrounding an ageing poet , whose deeply
c01-014-s00-03.png	egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
c01-014-s00-04.png	everything to his need of inspiration .
c01-014-s01-00.png	Henze
c01-014-s01-01.png	obtains his musical characterisation by means
c01-014-s01-02.png	of individual instrumental timbres and personal 
c01-014-s01-03.png	intervals , and the result is often less delineation
c01-014-s01-04.png	of character than caricature .
c01-014-s02-00.png	This is also the chief ,
c01-014-s02-01.png	or at least the most successfully executed trait
c01-014-s02-02.png	of the libretto , which contains an odd blend of highly
c01-066-s00-00.png	The evil that Byron did certainly lived after
c01-066-s00-01.png	him , and was even outmatched by the
c01-066-s00-02.png	mischief perpetrated by almost every person
c01-066-s00-03.png	who had been close to him .
c01-066-s01-00.png	In turning over
c01-066-s01-01.png	the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought
c01-066-s01-02.png	to light a great deal of discreditable
c01-066-s01-03.png	behaviour and a vision of mischief-
c01-066-s01-04.png	making propensities of the leisured
c01-066-s01-05.png	classes in the early 19th century which
c01-066-s01-06.png	leaves one a little breathless .
c02-000-s00-00.png	AFTER ten days of intermittent , near fatal
c02-000-s00-01.png	ennui , the eleventh Berlin International
c02-000-s00-02.png	Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to
c02-000-s00-03.png	life by two extraordinary films , Bernhard
c02-000-s00-04.png	Wicki's Das Wunder des Malachias ( The
c02-000-s00-05.png	Miracle of Father Malachias ) and Michael-
c02-000-s00-06.png	angelo Antonioni's La Notte . 
c02-000-s01-00.png	The num-
c02-000-s01-01.png	ber of German film directors who have
c02-000-s01-02.png	made first rate works in the last 25 years
c02-000-s01-03.png	can be counted on the fingers of one
c02-003-s00-00.png	It would now seem that Wicki's name must
c02-003-s00-01.png	be added to this list , for his new film
c02-003-s00-02.png	may well be a landmark in the revitali-
c02-003-s00-03.png	sation of the German cinema .
c02-003-s01-00.png	Wicki is
c02-003-s01-01.png	not only a director .
c02-003-s02-00.png	He began his career
c02-003-s02-01.png	as an actor , had his first important
c02-003-s02-02.png	film ro*?5le in Ka utner's Die letzt
c02-003-s02-03.png	Bru cke , and he also appears in the
c02-003-s02-04.png	new Antonioni film .
c02-007-s00-00.png	In 1950 he began to take photographs not
c02-007-s00-01.png	only in Germany but also in Africa and
c02-007-s00-02.png	America .
c02-007-s01-00.png	An exhibition of these works which
c02-007-s01-01.png	is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im-
c02-007-s01-02.png	pressive .
c02-007-s02-00.png	As Friedrich Du rrenmatt , the Swiss
c02-007-s02-01.png	playwright and author , wrote :
c02-007-s03-00.png	 Wicki's blacks
c02-007-s03-01.png	and greys are not only the colours of the
c02-007-s03-02.png	lost and the forgotten , but they are also the
c02-007-s03-03.png	technical means of abstraction .
c02-012-s00-00.png	Every unnecessary detail , all superfluous local
c02-012-s00-01.png	colouring must be eliminated .
c02-012-s01-00.png	He does not
c02-012-s01-01.png	want the accuracy of a police photograph ,
c02-012-s01-02.png	but rather he wants to show the eternal in
c02-012-s01-03.png	every instant . 
c02-012-s02-00.png	The chilling horror of Mala-
c02-012-s02-01.png	chias is due as much to Wicki the photo-
c02-012-s02-02.png	grapher as to Wicki the director .
c02-012-s03-00.png	His earlier
c02-012-s03-01.png	film , Die Bru cke , was equally terrifying ,
c02-012-s03-02.png	but here the director moves out of the world
c02-012-s03-03.png	of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum
c02-017-s00-00.png	Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
c02-017-s00-01.png	considerable fidelity , the film tells the story
c02-017-s00-02.png	of a little monk who prays that a disrepu-
c02-017-s00-03.png	table night club near his church be re-
c02-017-s00-04.png	moved .
c02-017-s01-00.png	One night his prayer is answered
c02-017-s01-01.png	and the offending establishment is suddenly
c02-017-s01-02.png	transplanted to an island in the North Sea .
c02-017-s02-00.png	But Father Malachias's troubles have only
c02-017-s02-01.png	begun .
c02-017-s03-00.png	Instead of having the desired effect ,
c02-017-s03-01.png	the miracle becomes exploited by a group
c02-022-s00-00.png	Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of
c02-022-s00-01.png	the missing building .
c02-022-s01-00.png	The Church rebukes the
c02-022-s01-01.png	poor monk for his miracle , and as a
c02-022-s01-02.png	crowning indignity the night club is
c02-022-s01-03.png	given a gala society reopening on the
c02-022-s01-04.png	island .
c02-022-s02-00.png	Father Malachias goes to the island ,
c02-022-s02-01.png	prays , and in a second miracle the
c02-022-s02-02.png	night club is replaced in its original
c02-022-s02-03.png	setting .
c02-026-s00-00.png	A summary of the story can give almost
c02-026-s00-01.png	indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry .
c02-026-s01-00.png	He
c02-026-s01-01.png	tells his story best in the faces of his crowds ,
c02-026-s01-02.png	recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat
c02-026-s01-03.png	with brutal honesty , building up to a
c02-026-s01-04.png	tremendous climax in the island orgy .
c02-026-s02-00.png	Here , the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts ,
c02-026-s02-01.png	the wildly flapping white sails slashed by
c02-026-s02-02.png	the glaring beacon of a lighthouse .
c02-030-s00-00.png	When the final miracle does occur , it is accepted as a
c02-030-s00-01.png	marvellous joke ; no one has learned anything .
c02-030-s01-00.png	Wicki
c02-030-s01-01.png	suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue .
c02-030-s02-00.png	In
c02-030-s02-01.png	complete silence he shows the faces of people
c02-030-s02-02.png	walking in the streets , smug , content , satisfied ,
c02-030-s02-03.png	and thoroughly frightening .
c02-030-s03-00.png	Wicki has
c02-030-s03-01.png	succeeded in his second film in
c02-030-s03-02.png	recording his personal apocalypse of the
c02-030-s03-03.png	last days of a sick society .
c02-035-s00-00.png	It is most unfair to call Malachias a cut-rate
c02-035-s00-01.png	 Dolce Vita , for it is far more intimate and deeply
c02-035-s00-02.png	felt .
c02-035-s01-00.png	In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat
c02-035-s01-01.png	in Titanic by paralleling the last days of the
c02-035-s01-02.png	Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner ,
c02-035-s01-03.png	and paid for his audacity with his life .
c02-049-s00-00.png	Strangely enough , the Berlin audience received
c02-049-s00-01.png	the film with extreme coolness , much preferring
c02-049-s00-02.png	Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing Une Femme
c02-049-s00-03.png	est une Femme , a ninety-one minute hymn
c02-049-s00-04.png	to Vogue , Cahiers du Cinema , and the
c02-049-s00-05.png	worst aspects of the American cinema .
c02-049-s01-00.png	From
c02-049-s01-01.png	a brilliantly funny start , the work fizzles
c02-049-s01-02.png	out into a series of repetitious sight-gags
c02-049-s01-03.png	and personal jokes incomprehensible to the
c02-049-s01-04.png	uninitiated ( including four plugs for Charles
c02-049-s01-05.png	Aznavour ) .
c02-056-s00-00.png	This director is at last being re-evaluated and
c02-056-s00-01.png	given his proper place in the history of the
c02-056-s00-02.png	German film .
c02-056-s01-00.png	Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
c02-056-s01-01.png	 Unheimliche Geschichten ( 1920 ) , five ghost stories
c02-056-s01-02.png	with a light touch , and there was much to admire
c02-056-s01-03.png	in Dreyfus ( 1930 ) and the virtually unknown
c02-056-s01-04.png	but extremely important 1914 ( 1931 ) , which
c02-056-s01-05.png	tries to show that it took more than just
c02-056-s01-06.png	Germany to start the First World War .
c02-059-s00-00.png	Sentence Database C02-059
c02-059-s01-00.png	Prizes being what they are , Berlin is unusually
c02-059-s01-01.png	generous in giving everyone something , and silver
c02-059-s01-02.png	bears are awarded in every direction .
c02-059-s02-00.png	Both the
c02-059-s02-01.png	Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours ,
c02-059-s02-02.png	and the audience at the awards was particularly
c02-059-s02-03.png	enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected
c02-059-s02-04.png	as best actress for her work in the Godard
c02-059-s02-05.png	film .
c02-059-s03-00.png	Gifted with an interesting face , although little
c02-059-s03-01.png	acting ability , she would seem to be well
c02-059-s03-02.png	worth watching in the months to come .
c02-078-s00-00.png	It has a great look of speed and technical fun
c02-078-s00-01.png	about it , of enormous cinematic enjoyment , and
c02-078-s00-02.png	above all of cinematic sense .
c02-078-s01-00.png	Much of it has
c02-078-s01-01.png	that air of improvisation , as of off-the-cuff
c02-078-s01-02.png	living , that once seemed so new and so
c02-078-s01-03.png	attractive .
c02-078-s02-00.png	The story ( not that the story , in the
c02-078-s02-01.png	sense of plot , matters much ; but in the sense of
c02-078-s02-02.png	situation and movement it matters a lot ) is
c02-078-s02-03.png	that of a man on the run ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) ,
c02-078-s02-04.png	who spends a few days with an American girl
c02-082-s00-00.png	Belmondo reappears at the Paris Pullman
c02-082-s00-01.png	in Moderato Cantabile ( curiously trans-
c02-082-s00-02.png	lated into Seven Days ... Seven Nights ...
c02-082-s00-03.png	A certificate ) , Peter Brook's film made
c02-082-s00-04.png	in France and shown last autumn at
c02-082-s00-05.png	the London Film Festival .
c02-082-s01-00.png	In spite of
c02-082-s01-01.png	magnificent performances from him and
c02-082-s01-02.png	from Jeanne Moreau , this has been fairly
c02-082-s01-03.png	well trounced by the critics wherever it
c02-082-s01-04.png	has appeared .
c02-082-s02-00.png	Leisurely , even slow ,

c02-089-s00-03.png	charming amid the nonsense , and Karl
c02-089-s00-04.png	Malden not knowing how to take it ,
c02-089-s00-05.png	all rolling eyeballs like a villain

c03-087f-s00-00.png	It went , perhaps , some distance beyond

c03-087f-s00-02.png	to generate a melodramatic inevitability
c03-087f-s00-03.png	which left its central character and the

c04-000-s00-00.png	NEXT month that friendly , effervescent performer Frankie
c04-000-s00-01.png	Vaughan will burst on to the London Palladium stage
c04-000-s00-02.png	in a new show .
c04-000-s01-00.png	To paraphrase his well-known ditty :
c04-000-s02-00.png	 He 'll have the limelight , they 'll give him the girls -
c04-000-s02-01.png	and leave the rest to him . 
c04-004-s00-00.png	I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the
c04-004-s00-01.png	old , star-studded West End than he will ever feel in
c04-004-s00-02.png	Hollywood .
c04-004-s01-00.png	His American bosses , 20th-Century Fox , have
c04-004-s01-01.png	recently given Frankie the full , razzamataz , red-carpet
c04-004-s01-02.png	treatment .
c04-004-s02-00.png	But they haven't done a thing for his film
c04-004-s02-01.png	career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not
c04-004-s02-02.png	doing better here , before the platinum-plated Hollywood
c04-004-s02-03.png	carrot was dangled before his nose .
c04-008-s00-00.png	In his first Hollywood picture , Let 's Make Love , he
c04-008-s00-01.png	was swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe
c04-008-s00-02.png	and Yves Montand .
c04-008-s01-00.png	Against this couple Frankie , in
c04-008-s01-01.png	a cardboard role , didn't stand a chance .
c04-008-s02-00.png	Now comes
c04-008-s02-01.png	 The Right Approach ( Rialto , A ) , and it 's a glum
c04-008-s02-02.png	business .
c04-008-s03-00.png	He plays an aspiring actor - a
c04-008-s03-01.png	selfish , arrogant , brash , ambitious , unscrupulous heel -
c04-008-s03-02.png	who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in
c04-008-s03-03.png	the Hollywood ratrace .
c04-013-s00-00.png	He double-crosses the five pals with whom he lives ,
c04-013-s00-01.png	cheats a waitress ( Juliet Prowse ) and cynically uses
c04-013-s00-02.png	a magazine editress ( Martha Hyer ) to get ahead .
c04-013-s01-00.png	Frankie Vaughan is too nice a chap to ring quite
c04-013-s01-01.png	true as a smooth-tongued , ill-mannered Yank .
c04-013-s02-00.png	His
c04-013-s02-01.png	best moments are when he swings breezily into the
c04-013-s02-02.png	title song .
c04-017-s00-00.png	But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go
c04-017-s00-01.png	for a new hit song .
c04-017-s01-00.png	He might be well advised to
c04-017-s01-01.png	think hard and long before his next jump into the
c04-017-s01-02.png	Hollywood arena .
c04-017-s02-00.png	VERDICT :
c04-017-s03-00.png	Vaughan should have by-passed this approach .
c04-017-s04-00.png	RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the
c04-017-s04-01.png	Hollywood treatment , thanks to a sound performance in
c04-017-s04-02.png	 Taste of Fear ( Warner Theatre , X ) .
c04-023-s00-00.png	He has earned his break .
c04-023-s01-00.png	The film is a well-made
c04-023-s01-01.png	variation on that sinister yarn in which half the cast
c04-023-s01-02.png	try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her mind .
c04-023-s02-00.png	Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is
c04-023-s02-01.png	built up neatly .
c04-023-s03-00.png	Susan Strasberg is the crippled
c04-023-s03-01.png	damsel in distress .
c04-028-s00-00.png	Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are
c04-028-s00-01.png	also effectively around .
c04-028-s01-00.png	They provide some chilly red
c04-028-s01-01.png	herrings in this Find-the-body thriller .
c04-028-s02-00.png	VERDICT :
c04-028-s03-00.png	Don't believe all you see and hear !
c04-028-s04-00.png	NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney
c04-028-s04-01.png	James has pumped life into a slim , strained
c04-028-s04-02.png	comedy .
c04-028-s05-00.png	He does his rescue act in Double Bunk 
c04-028-s05-01.png	( Leicester-square Theatre , A ) .
c04-035-s00-00.png	Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when
c04-035-s00-01.png	newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let
c04-035-s00-02.png	loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down
c04-035-s00-03.png	the river .
c04-035-s01-00.png	The film starts off brightly enough but ,
c04-035-s01-01.png	half-way through , the plot ( as well as the boat ) springs
c04-035-s01-02.png	a near-disastrous leak .
c04-035-s02-00.png	Familiar members of Britain's
c04-035-s02-01.png	repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through
c04-035-s02-02.png	equally familiar hoops to mild laughter .
c04-039-s00-00.png	VERDICT :
c04-039-s01-00.png	The bunk needed doubling .
c04-039-s02-00.png	DONALD HOUSTON had a big success on A
c04-039-s02-01.png	 Drama '61 last night as a smooth ,
c04-039-s02-02.png	scheming jewel thief in a play by Jacques
c04-039-s02-03.png	Gillies , The Takers . 
c04-039-s03-00.png	A polished production
c04-039-s03-01.png	by Quentin Lawrence , here , held together
c04-039-s03-02.png	by Mr. Houston's accomplished
c04-039-s03-03.png	performance as the master mind behind a
c04-039-s03-04.png	gang of crooks .
c04-044-s00-00.png	This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000
c04-044-s00-01.png	worth of jewellery struck me as ingenious .
c04-044-s01-00.png	The play
c04-044-s01-01.png	had style , moved at a quick pace and everyone did
c04-044-s01-02.png	well .
c04-044-s02-00.png	But it was Mr. Houston's evening .
c04-044-s03-00.png	Earlier , on the Palladium show I found Stanley
c04-044-s03-01.png	Holloway's act too long and not particularly
c04-044-s03-02.png	entertaining .
c04-044-s04-00.png	It was also a mistake to
c04-044-s04-01.png	re-book Gene Detroy and his performing chimpanzees
c04-044-s04-02.png	so soon after their previous appearance .
c04-050-s00-00.png	Their offering last night differed little
c04-050-s00-01.png	from their earlier act on this show a week
c04-050-s00-02.png	or so ago .
c04-050-s01-00.png	But the Mudlarks , with Jeff Mudd
c04-050-s01-01.png	out of the Army and back with sister Mary
c04-050-s01-02.png	and brother Fred , were in bright , zestful
c04-050-s01-03.png	form .
c04-050-s02-00.png	Why only two numbers , though ?
c04-050-s03-00.png	It
c04-050-s03-01.png	was not enough .
c04-050-s04-00.png	 A FAIR COP , the B
c04-050-s04-01.png	Whitehall farce last night , looked like
c04-050-s04-02.png	a rabbit warren in a field of corn .
c04-056-s00-00.png	I can't recall a production where so many
c04-056-s00-01.png	comics bolted in and out of holes so often .
c04-056-s01-00.png	The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
c04-056-s01-01.png	lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
c04-056-s01-02.png	of his trousers .
c04-056-s02-00.png	The action moved at tremendous
c04-056-s02-01.png	speed , backed by some wonderful timing by
c04-056-s02-02.png	the cast .
c04-056-s03-00.png	I especially liked the tea-cup
c04-056-s03-01.png	scene where six of the cast changed
c04-056-s03-02.png	cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers .
c04-061-s00-00.png	Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
c04-061-s00-01.png	as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable .
c04-061-s01-00.png	They
c04-061-s01-01.png	alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
c04-061-s01-02.png	through the gormless standing corn around them .
c04-061-s02-00.png	Perhaps
c04-061-s02-01.png	it was accidental - I hope not .
c04-061-s03-00.png	If ever a bag of
c04-061-s03-01.png	humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall
c04-061-s03-02.png	farce is it when it comes to television .
c04-066-s00-00.png	HOW do you get on records ?
c04-066-s01-00.png	Well , you 've got
c04-066-s01-01.png	to have something different .
c04-066-s02-00.png	Sing slightly flat .
c04-066-s03-00.png	All the good singers sing in tune .
c04-066-s04-00.png	Twang a guitar
c04-066-s04-01.png	slightly off key .
c04-066-s05-00.png	Everybody 's fed up with the
c04-066-s05-01.png	right way - so the best-seller charts say .
c04-066-s06-00.png	Play
c04-066-s06-01.png	an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one .
c04-066-s07-00.png	You got to
c04-066-s07-01.png	get it into your head , son ... people
c04-066-s07-02.png	don't like things as they should be - not on
c04-066-s07-03.png	record , anyway .
c04-075-s00-00.png	Thus , musician David Lisbon's chances of being a starred
c04-075-s00-01.png	disc solo pianist were greatly enhanced when he dug out
c04-075-s00-02.png	A PACKET OF DRAWING-PINS .
c04-075-s01-00.png	 Why not , thought ex-soldier
c04-075-s01-01.png	Mr. Lisbon , who is twenty-three , and lives in Dagenham , Essex ,
c04-075-s01-02.png	 press a thumb-tack into the nose of the hammers that strike
c04-075-s01-03.png	the piano strings ? 
c04-075-s02-00.png	He did , on his piano at home .
c04-075-s03-00.png	There weren't
c04-075-s03-01.png	enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers done .
c04-080-s00-00.png	Then he tried it out for sound .
c04-080-s01-00.png	Um-chink ...
c04-080-s01-01.png	um-chink ... it went .
c04-080-s02-00.png	Slightly flat and jangly in
c04-080-s02-01.png	part .
c04-080-s03-00.png	DELIGHTFUL !
c04-080-s04-00.png	He put the sound on tape .
c04-080-s05-00.png	The
c04-080-s05-01.png	tape went to the Philips company .
c04-080-s06-00.png	Within two
c04-080-s06-01.png	days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract .
c04-080-s07-00.png	And they

c04-080-s07-02.png	miles to London for his first session .
c04-089-s00-00.png	Now along comes his solo disc , featuring two of his own
c04-089-s00-01.png	compositions , Deerstalker and Almost Grown Up . 
c04-089-s01-00.png	VERDICT :
c04-089-s02-00.png	Mr. Lisbon has it taped .
c04-089-s03-00.png	And tacked .
c04-089-s04-00.png	And he says :
c04-089-s05-00.png	 Just as well
c04-089-s05-01.png	I had only one box of tacks - it might have been so

c04-144-s03-01.png	success last night in I
c04-144-s03-02.png	first big T
c04-144-s04-00.png	The play was a brilliantly-written
c04-144-s04-01.png	essay on soldiering which stated that a fighting
c04-144-s04-02.png	man could only be regarded as a machine .
c04-150-s00-00.png	Potter screamed during an action , and was arrested .

c04-150-s02-01.png	Northern defiance .
c04-150-s03-00.png	The cameras played continuously on his
c04-150-s03-01.png	craggy face , and obstinate , baffled eyes .
c04-150-s04-00.png	They stripped
c04-150-s04-01.png	him of his ugly battle-dress , to leave him for
c04-150-s04-02.png	what he was - Potter , a frightened boy who had a
c04-150-s04-03.png	vision .
c04-156-s00-00.png	It was a splendid interpretation of the
c04-156-s00-01.png	part .
c04-156-s01-00.png	The rest of the cast were well chosen ,

c04-160-s00-00.png	The play was no more than a figment of
c04-160-s00-01.png	the imagination which asked the viewer to
c04-160-s00-02.png	believe in a beautiful ghost .
c04-160-s01-00.png	It would have been
c04-160-s01-01.png	an impossible piece of television but for clever
c04-160-s01-02.png	production by Michael Hayes .

c04-160-s02-01.png	the atmosphere of fog and mystery to great

c04-165-s01-01.png	of an American T
c04-165-s01-02.png	British personalities .
c04-165-s02-00.png	Among them - Professor
c04-165-s02-01.png	Dennis Brogan , Shelagh Delaney , and Alan Sillitoe .
c04-165-s03-00.png	The film covered a wide aspect of the British
c04-165-s03-01.png	scene , ranging from pubs , the Eton wall game ,
c04-165-s03-02.png	to the European Common Market .
c04-170-s00-00.png	Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked
c04-170-s00-01.png	education .
c04-170-s01-00.png	It was left to reporter Sevareid
c04-170-s01-01.png	to make the strongest criticisms .
c04-170-s02-00.png	He said
c04-170-s02-01.png	that in the race of the modern nations ,
c04-170-s02-02.png	Britain was slipping behind ... .
c06-000-s00-00.png	IT is mid-morning on a Dublin Sunday .
c06-000-s01-00.png	The streets
c06-000-s01-01.png	are tranquilly sunny and still , for the town
c06-000-s01-02.png	is at Mass .
c06-000-s02-00.png	Most of it .
c06-000-s03-00.png	In the front room of
c06-000-s03-01.png	a house in Anglesey-road is a congregation who
c06-000-s03-02.png	never actually got to church , but who are
c06-000-s03-03.png	gathered with devotion around Brendan Behan
c06-000-s03-04.png	and a brandy bottle .
c06-005-s00-00.png	Where the 2bhoys are .
c06-005-s01-00.png	In the hallway are
c06-005-s01-01.png	the empties ; through the door hearts are
c06-005-s01-02.png	full , hopes are high .
c06-005-s02-00.png	There are still a few
c06-005-s02-01.png	amber inches in the bottle .
c06-005-s03-00.png	Present are some
c06-005-s03-01.png	hard-core Friends of Brendan .
c06-005-s04-00.png	They listen
c06-005-s04-01.png	with many an obliging guffaw to the
c06-005-s04-02.png	brandy owner's solo swish on his anecdotal
c06-005-s04-03.png	roller-coaster , with occasional stops for an old
c06-005-s04-04.png	I.R.A. air or a Connemara tear-jerker .
c06-011-s00-00.png	ALSO present is a London journalist who
c06-011-s00-01.png	arrived two hours earlier by appointment
c06-011-s00-02.png	to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
c06-011-s00-03.png	The Hostage about his new work , if any ,
c06-011-s00-04.png	and who is now being pluckily convivial
c06-011-s00-05.png	to fight off the frustration .
c06-011-s01-00.png	The telephone
c06-011-s01-01.png	has rung a couple of times , calls from
c06-011-s01-02.png	other chums sniffing the wind and
c06-011-s01-03.png	offering to drop by for a chat .
c06-014-s00-00.png	At last Brendan - to the journalist's
c06-014-s00-01.png	relief - turns his attention to
c06-014-s00-02.png	the writing scene .
c06-014-s01-00.png	He proceeds to
c06-014-s01-01.png	place himself in the literary hierarchy .
c06-014-s02-00.png	 I consider myself , he says , a cut
c06-014-s02-01.png	above Evelyn Waugh socially , a cut
c06-014-s02-02.png	above Nancy Mitford artistically , a
c06-014-s02-03.png	cut above Frank Haxell conversationally .
c06-014-s03-00.png	 But , he continues , the greatest is
c06-014-s03-01.png	Shelagh Delaney .
c06-014-s04-00.png	Just because A Taste
c06-020-s00-00.png	That 's as bloody silly as calling a Rolls-
c06-020-s00-01.png	Royce a type of transport .
c06-020-s01-00.png	She 's the
c06-020-s01-01.png	flower in a cultural desert .
c06-020-s02-00.png	 Now , me - I 'm
c06-020-s02-01.png	a journalist , I write to entertain rather
c06-020-s02-02.png	than educate .
c06-020-s03-00.png	And I don't write at all
c06-020-s03-01.png	unless I 'm exceedingly 2skint .
c06-020-s04-00.png	 But I 'll
c06-020-s04-01.png	say this .
c06-020-s05-00.png	I 'd like to live in America
c06-020-s05-01.png	and do some writing there .
c06-027-s00-00.png	It 's a very free place to write in , and there 's
c06-027-s00-01.png	the advantage that no one knows what
c06-027-s00-02.png	you 're writing about anyway .
c06-027-s01-00.png	 Not that I did
c06-027-s01-01.png	much when I was over this past two times ,
c06-027-s01-02.png	not with that great little Irish bar on
c06-027-s01-03.png	Seventh Avenue , The Pigsty , always open .
c06-027-s02-00.png	I was there , in even faster orbit , when that
c06-027-s02-01.png	third astronaut went up - what 's his name ?
c06-031-s00-00.png	I 'm the only man on earth who doesn't know
c06-031-s00-01.png	what his name is .
c06-031-s01-00.png	Don't tell me .
c06-031-s02-00.png	I want to
c06-031-s02-01.png	preserve that distinction .
c06-031-s03-00.png	 I already know about
c06-031-s03-01.png	Shepard and that Salvation Army chap Gagarin -
c06-031-s03-02.png	the two biggest bores since Cardinal Newman .
c06-031-s04-00.png	That 's enough of all that hooey . 
c06-031-s05-00.png	HE plunges
c06-031-s05-01.png	on into reminiscences of his trips .
c06-031-s06-00.png	There is
c06-031-s06-01.png	much to recall .
c06-039-s00-00.png	Among other incidents he was banned from New
c06-039-s00-01.png	York's St. Patrick's Day parade as a disorderly
c06-039-s00-02.png	person . 
c06-039-s01-00.png	He was in a fight after telling a
c06-039-s01-01.png	Canadian , during a chat about space-flight :
c06-039-s02-00.png	 Ireland will put a shillelagh into orbit , Israel
c06-039-s02-01.png	will put a matzo ball into orbit , and Lichtenstein
c06-039-s02-02.png	will put a postage stamp into orbit before you
c06-039-s02-03.png	Canadians put up a mouse . 
c06-043-s00-00.png	And he suffered an alcoholic
c06-043-s00-01.png	seizure and was gravely ill in
c06-043-s00-02.png	hospital with a diabetic and heart
c06-043-s00-03.png	condition .
c06-043-s01-00.png	His return to Dublin was
c06-043-s01-01.png	heralded by the announcement that
c06-043-s01-02.png	he was off the gargle - a retired
c06-043-s01-03.png	alcoholic . 
c06-043-s02-00.png	Since then he has been
c06-043-s02-01.png	heard of often in the newspapers -
c06-043-s02-02.png	three times up before the beaks for
c06-043-s02-03.png	drunk and disorderly conduct .
c06-047-s00-00.png	LESS has been heard of Brendan's work .
c06-047-s01-00.png	It is now
c06-047-s01-01.png	five years since his first play , The Quare Fellow , was
c06-047-s01-02.png	produced , three years since Borstal Boy was published
c06-047-s01-03.png	and The Hostage was put on .
c06-047-s02-00.png	What has happened to
c06-047-s02-01.png	the play , Richard's Cork Leg , begun 18 months ago
c06-047-s02-02.png	and due for presentation at the Theatre Royal ,
c06-047-s02-03.png	Stratford , last spring ?
c06-047-s03-00.png	It was never finished .
c06-052-s00-00.png	What happened to the new book partially tape-recorded
c06-052-s00-01.png	by his publishers in March of last year ?
c06-052-s01-00.png	Still a skeleton .
c06-052-s02-00.png	Yet
c06-052-s02-01.png	I have before me now a 12,000-word manuscript of
c06-052-s02-02.png	a book planned to be called Confessions of an Irish
c06-052-s02-03.png	Rebel which was delivered to his agents in June .
c06-052-s03-00.png	IT
c06-052-s03-01.png	begins :
c06-052-s04-00.png	 There was a party to celebrate Deirdre's
c06-052-s04-01.png	return from her abortion in Bristol . 
c06-058-s00-00.png	It is ribald , funny , brilliantly observant
c06-058-s00-01.png	of character , and authentic as a glass
c06-058-s00-02.png	of draught porter .
c06-058-s01-00.png	But will we see its
c06-058-s01-01.png	end ?
c06-058-s02-00.png	The last scene of this fragment
c06-058-s02-01.png	is in a pub where the author throws a
c06-058-s02-02.png	10 note on to the bar and orders a
c06-058-s02-03.png	round for the pals , one of whom cries :
c06-076-s00-00.png	I AM happy to report that I saw some-
c06-076-s00-01.png	thing this week I have never before witnessed ,
c06-076-s00-02.png	either in pictures or outside - a budgerigar
c06-076-s00-03.png	playing a drunk scene , and playing it with
c06-076-s00-04.png	perfect timing and technique .
c06-076-s01-00.png	It gives one loud ,
c06-076-s01-01.png	clear hiccup and falls flat on its back .
c06-076-s02-00.png	This
c06-076-s02-01.png	brilliant budge , I may add , gets no credit
c06-076-s02-02.png	in the cast list of Come September ( Odeon ,
c06-076-s02-03.png	Leicester-square ) , which suggests that it
c06-076-s02-04.png	is either using a stand-in for the stunt
c06-080-s00-00.png	The performance of our talented
c06-080-s00-01.png	feathered friend is not the only
c06-080-s00-02.png	good thing ( although the one original
c06-080-s00-03.png	touch ) in the film , which is better-
c06-080-s00-04.png	than-average glossy comedy , Hollywood-
c06-080-s00-05.png	styled , European set .
c06-080-s01-00.png	Most of it has
c06-080-s01-01.png	been shot in and around the
c06-080-s01-02.png	sun-terrace of the Hotel Splendido ( renamed
c06-080-s01-03.png	the Dolce Vista for the picture ) in
c06-080-s01-04.png	Portofino - and if there 's a better view
c06-083-s00-00.png	It also parades Gina Lollobrigida in a selection of neglige*?
c06-083-s00-01.png	2e-and-nightie ensembles not too well designed for sleeping in ,
c06-083-s00-02.png	and Rock Hudson at the wheel of a shining silver Rolls-Royce .
c06-083-s01-00.png	Mr. Hudson is an American millionaire who spends each
c06-083-s01-01.png	September in his Italian villa and the company of Signorina
c06-083-s01-02.png	Lollobrigida .
c06-083-s02-00.png	In the holiday seasonal months before and
c06-083-s02-01.png	after this annual idyll his major-domo ( Walter Slezak
c06-083-s02-02.png	at his most nauseating ) turns the palazzo into a luxury
c06-083-s02-03.png	hotel .
c06-087-s00-00.png	#
c06-087-s00-01.png	Inevitably there comes the time when Mr. Hudson suddenly breaks
c06-087-s00-02.png	with tradition and arrives there in July , when , just as
c06-087-s00-03.png	inevitably , the place is full of American teenagers on an
c06-087-s00-04.png	escorted tour .
c06-087-s01-00.png	Result :
c06-087-s02-00.png	Mr. Hudson and lady love Lollo find
c06-087-s02-01.png	themselves playing chaperon ( Brenda de Banzie , the official
c06-087-s02-02.png	one , has broken a leg ) to the girls , who have just
c06-087-s02-03.png	been joined by a Jeep-load of boys .
c06-091-s00-00.png	It 's hereabouts that the budge takes to the bottle , but I
c06-091-s00-01.png	don't think it was through boredom .
c06-091-s01-00.png	The film is funny enough
c06-091-s01-01.png	in places and has a line or two of painful home truths
c06-091-s01-02.png	thrown in .
c06-091-s02-00.png	 I don't want to talk like an adult , screams
c06-091-s02-01.png	Gina , walking out on the man who has so far
c06-091-s02-02.png	failed to make an honest woman of her .
c06-095-s00-00.png	 That 's how I got into all this trouble . 
c06-095-s01-00.png	 He 's got to be 35 , says Bobby Darin ,
c06-095-s01-01.png	the chief spokesman of the jeans-and-
c06-095-s01-02.png	Jeep brigadiers as they 're scheming to
c06-095-s01-03.png	get rid of old man , solid Rock .
c06-095-s02-00.png	 How
c06-095-s02-01.png	many hills can he take ? 
c06-095-s03-00.png	Of course Mr.
c06-095-s03-01.png	Hudson can take one more hill than the
c06-095-s03-02.png	youngsters .
c06-100-s00-00.png	So all ends as you know it will , with the
c06-100-s00-01.png	middle-aged romancers respectably wed and
c06-100-s00-02.png	Master Darin going steady with the delectable
c06-100-s00-03.png	Sandra Dee ( to whom , I believe , he is married
c06-100-s00-04.png	in real life ) .
c06-100-s01-00.png	Miss Dee , incidentally , who keeps
c06-100-s01-01.png	turning up as the typical teenager in all the
c06-100-s01-02.png	 good girl parts ( Tuesday Weld gets the bad girl 
c06-100-s01-03.png	ones ) , is becoming quite an accomplished actress .
c06-103-s00-00.png	THE Marriage-Go-Round ( Carlton )
c06-103-s00-01.png	is also a comedy of manners ,
c06-103-s00-02.png	but fun-films toting an X
c06-103-s00-03.png	certificate have to keep a sharp
c06-103-s00-04.png	look-out that the jokes about
c06-103-s00-05.png	sex ( what else would they joke
c06-103-s00-06.png	about with an X ? ) are of the witty ,
c06-103-s00-07.png	verbal variety and not the visual
c06-103-s00-08.png	slapstick .
c06-103-s01-00.png	This has only one gag -
c06-103-s01-01.png	that of the entry of a gladiator
c06-106-s00-00.png	The girl is a knock-out ( see pic-
c06-106-s00-01.png	ture of Julie Newmar for con-
c06-106-s00-02.png	firmation ) .
c06-106-s01-00.png	She also has quite a
c06-106-s01-01.png	mission in mind .
c06-106-s02-00.png	She , younger ,
c06-106-s02-01.png	prettier , stronger , and more
c06-106-s02-02.png	intelligent than the wife ( as she
c06-106-s02-03.png	soon tells her ) , wants to have the
c06-106-s02-04.png	perfect baby .
c06-106-s03-00.png	And she has chosen
c06-106-s03-01.png	the husband ( James Mason ) , who
c06-106-s03-02.png	is an academic friend of her
c06-106-s03-03.png	Nobel prize-winning father to be
c06-111-s00-00.png	This sort of situation calls for some subtle ,
c06-111-s00-01.png	slightly sardonic handling .
c06-111-s01-00.png	It doesn't get it .
c06-111-s02-00.png	But
c06-111-s02-01.png	The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of
c06-111-s02-02.png	time .
c06-111-s03-00.png	I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced
c06-111-s03-01.png	Studies attached to some American universities
c06-111-s03-02.png	the subject Social Psychology used to be called
c06-111-s03-03.png	Home-making and is now known as Domestic
c06-111-s03-04.png	Relations .
c06-116-s00-00.png	Susan Hayward plays the wife sharply
c06-116-s00-01.png	and sweetly .
c06-116-s01-00.png	Mason is always good for
c06-116-s01-01.png	a glower .
c06-116-s02-00.png	And Miss Newmar is a
c06-116-s02-01.png	stunner in every sense of the word .
c06-116-s03-00.png	According to the script she was once
c06-116-s03-01.png	captain of the junior hockey team at
c06-116-s03-02.png	her school .
c06-116-s04-00.png	So help me so was I .
c06-116-s05-00.png	IL GRIDO ( The Cry ) - Paris Pullman -
c06-116-s05-01.png	is an earlier essay in atmospheric
c06-116-s05-02.png	meandering by the L'Avventura man ,
c06-116-s05-03.png	Michelangelo Antonioni .
c06-128-s00-00.png	ON a March evening in 1932 in the New
c06-128-s00-01.png	Jersey family household the nursemaid
c06-128-s00-02.png	tiptoed into the baby's room to see that
c06-128-s00-03.png	20-month-old Charles Jun. was sleeping .
c06-128-s01-00.png	Bending over the cot , she suddenly realised
c06-128-s01-01.png	that there was no sound of breathing .
c06-128-s02-00.png	She thrust out her hand - and felt
c06-128-s02-01.png	emptiness .
c06-128-s03-00.png	A FEW minutes later the father
c06-128-s03-01.png	gripping a loaded rifle , told his wife :
c06-138-s00-00.png	The plain , sober manner of its
c06-138-s00-01.png	style all the more tellingly
c06-138-s00-02.png	points up not only the horror
c06-138-s00-03.png	of the case itself , which
c06-138-s00-04.png	floundered on to the electrocution
c06-138-s00-05.png	four years later of a German-
c06-138-s00-06.png	born Bronx carpenter named
c06-138-s00-07.png	Bruno Richard Hauptmann , but
c06-138-s00-08.png	to the raree-show emotionalism
c06-138-s00-09.png	and sensation-hunger of that
c06-138-s00-10.png	era .
d01-016-s00-00.png	The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
d01-016-s00-01.png	the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
d01-016-s00-02.png	plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote .
d01-016-s01-00.png	The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
d01-019-s00-00.png	There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
d01-019-s00-01.png	Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations .
d01-019-s01-00.png	The
d01-019-s01-01.png	present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history .
d01-019-s02-00.png	The
d01-019-s02-01.png	original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was
d01-019-s02-02.png	accidentally damaged .
d01-019-s03-00.png	An editor , who was not the author , made what he
d01-019-s03-01.png	could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order .
d01-024-s00-00.png	Most of those who expound a theory of textual
d01-024-s00-01.png	dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
d01-024-s00-02.png	written entirely by one author before the
d01-024-s00-03.png	disturbance took place but a few leave it open
d01-024-s00-04.png	to suppose that the original book had been
d01-024-s00-05.png	revised even before the upheaval .
d01-024-s01-00.png	The ingenuity
d01-024-s01-01.png	of the theories is impressive and is the best
d01-024-s01-02.png	argument against them .
d01-024-s02-00.png	Thomas Spreng
d01-049-s00-00.png	The one real weakness of the Commentator's
d01-049-s00-01.png	case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,
d01-049-s00-02.png	he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly
d01-049-s00-03.png	how this enlargement was effected nor has he
d01-049-s00-04.png	been able to explain the textual movements by
d01-049-s00-05.png	showing that such changes are part of a
d01-049-s00-06.png	simple and coherent plan .
d01-049-s01-00.png	To understand how
d01-049-s01-01.png	this is possible it is necessary to examine the
d01-049-s01-02.png	text of the Gospel .
d01-052-s00-00.png	THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
d01-052-s00-01.png	written in Greek .
d01-052-s01-00.png	A modern text of the
d01-052-s01-01.png	Gospel represents the work of generations of
d01-052-s01-02.png	scholars who have compared the many manu-
d01-052-s01-03.png	scripts of John and worked out the version
d01-052-s01-04.png	which is most likely to have been the original
d01-052-s01-05.png	wording .
d01-052-s02-00.png	It is not possible to establish any one
d01-052-s02-01.png	text with absolute precision .
d01-056-s00-00.png	The most convenient one for the authors
d01-056-s00-01.png	has been the text of A. Souter .
d01-056-s01-00.png	In this
d01-056-s01-01.png	version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
d01-056-s01-02.png	printed as just over 1,000 different nouns ,
d01-056-s01-03.png	verbs , and other parts of speech occurring
d01-056-s01-04.png	15,695 times in their different grammatical
d01-056-s01-05.png	forms .
d01-056-s02-00.png	There are other texts which could
d01-056-s02-01.png	have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 )
d01-056-s02-02.png	it is not a matter of the greatest importance
d01-056-s02-03.png	which text is used .
d01-060-s00-00.png	At first sight the difference between
d01-060-s00-01.png	Souter and the other texts is rather
d01-060-s00-02.png	large .
d01-060-s01-00.png	But the British text includes
d01-060-s01-01.png	the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman
d01-060-s01-02.png	taken in Adultery , and this accounts
d01-060-s01-03.png	for 178 words out of 279 , which is
d01-060-s01-04.png	the difference between the 15,695 words
d01-060-s01-05.png	of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's .
d01-060-s02-00.png	The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
d01-060-s02-01.png	is a matter of editorial decision rather
d01-080-s00-00.png	The bar was the commonest marking , but others
d01-080-s00-01.png	were also used .
d01-080-s01-00.png	Dots sometimes served in place of the
d01-080-s01-01.png	bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as
d01-080-s01-02.png	it is now used to mark a paragraph ending .
d01-080-s02-00.png	Frequently
d01-080-s02-01.png	paragraphos markings were omitted .
d01-080-s03-00.png	C. H. Roberts is of
d01-080-s03-01.png	the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
d01-080-s03-02.png	some markings would be used , although which , it is
d01-080-s03-03.png	impossible to say .
d01-085-s00-00.png	Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
d01-085-s00-01.png	the original of the Gospel would be unmarked .
d01-085-s01-00.png	The
d01-085-s01-01.png	original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,
d01-085-s01-02.png	whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in
d01-085-s01-03.png	columns .
d01-085-s02-00.png	This is the invariable practice of ancient
d01-085-s02-01.png	manuscripts .
d01-085-s03-00.png	A common size of column would hold
d01-085-s03-01.png	about one third of a page of Souter's print .
d01-098-s00-00.png	The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01-098-s00-01.png	and the sheet wound round this central pin .
d01-098-s01-00.png	The roll made
d01-098-s01-01.png	a simple and serviceable book .
d01-098-s02-00.png	It was robust - the number
d01-098-s02-01.png	which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01-098-s02-02.png	this - and it was easily stored .
d01-098-s03-00.png	It had two disadvantages .
d01-098-s04-00.png	It
d01-098-s04-01.png	was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not
d01-098-s04-02.png	an easy form of book in which to find a
d01-098-s04-03.png	reference .
d01-104-s00-00.png	This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-s00-01.png	ecclesiastical circles .
d01-104-s01-00.png	In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,
d01-104-s01-01.png	the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01-104-s02-00.png	As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-s02-01.png	overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his
d01-104-s02-02.png	information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01-104-s03-00.png	The other form of book was the codex .
d01-104-s04-00.png	In this the
d01-104-s04-01.png	sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d01-104-s04-02.png	they are in modern books .
d01-118-s00-00.png	Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
d01-118-s00-01.png	might be bulky .
d01-118-s01-00.png	It is sometimes possible to tell
d01-118-s01-01.png	whether or not a particular text was written on
d01-118-s01-02.png	a roll or a codex .
d01-118-s02-00.png	Rolls were prepared for
d01-118-s02-01.png	writing , but any papyrus left unused at the
d01-118-s02-02.png	end could be cut off .
d01-118-s03-00.png	If the text was longer than
d01-118-s03-01.png	the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on .
d01-123-s00-00.png	The verso of the roll was blank , and one
d01-123-s00-01.png	cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,
d01-123-s00-02.png	sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,
d01-123-s00-03.png	while one whole side of his roll was unused .
d01-123-s01-00.png	The codex form was not so accommodating .
d01-123-s02-00.png	Even
d01-123-s02-01.png	in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra
d01-123-s02-02.png	sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
d01-123-s02-03.png	over the binding , or the whole codex rebound .
d03-112-s00-00.png	Close to the building projects would be the
d03-112-s00-01.png	VINEYARDS ( 1 Kings 4.25 ; S. of Sol. 8.11 ) .
d03-112-s01-00.png	The word is a Persian loan-word ,
d03-112-s01-01.png	pairi-deaza , from which our word paradise
d03-112-s01-02.png	is derived .
d03-112-s02-00.png	Qoheleth has a second
d03-112-s02-01.png	paradise at his disposal but he is
d03-112-s02-02.png	no happier than Adam was !
d03-112-s03-00.png	The word is used in the singular

d03-117-s03-00.png	And I built Baal-meon and made

d04-005-s00-02.png	the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
d04-005-s00-03.png	Shamir had not been placed under his charge , as
d04-005-s00-04.png	there is no Shamir in Gehenna ( Hell ) .
d04-005-s01-00.png	An eagle
d04-005-s01-01.png	brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden ,
d04-005-s01-02.png	the Paradise , the only place where the Shamir
d04-005-s01-03.png	could be found .
d04-008-s00-00.png	The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in
d04-008-s00-01.png	a sanctuary , and only some rare birds know
d04-008-s00-02.png	the existence of it .
d04-008-s01-00.png	These birds are , the Cherubim
d04-008-s01-01.png	and the Seraphim .
d04-008-s02-00.png	We are also told that the Shamir
d04-008-s02-01.png	is the stylus used by Moses , and this stylus is described
d04-008-s02-02.png	as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant .
d04-012-s00-00.png	The word Shamir was used as a
d04-012-s00-01.png	personal name ( Git. 68a ) .
d04-012-s01-00.png	The Hebrew
d04-012-s01-01.png	word SHAMIR means guarded or preser-
d04-012-s01-02.png	ved .
d04-012-s02-00.png	Therefore , the real man , who
d04-012-s02-01.png	regards himself as insignificant , as the
d04-012-s02-02.png	prayer says : What am I ? A worm , he
d04-012-s02-03.png	is the Shamir and such a man fulfils
d04-012-s02-04.png	the Shmah , loves the Lord God with
d04-012-s02-05.png	all his heart , and with all his soul and
d04-012-s02-06.png	with all his might and studies the
d04-012-s02-07.png	word of God .
d04-016-s00-00.png	This man is the worm , the creature that
d04-016-s00-01.png	cuts and polishes Altar-Stones .
d04-016-s01-00.png	Such
d04-016-s01-01.png	a man is the Shamir that guards him-
d04-016-s01-02.png	self against all the irrelevant pleasures .
d04-016-s02-00.png	Such a Shamir possesses the real acid
d04-016-s02-01.png	to mould our character , to melt our
d04-016-s02-02.png	heart of stone .
d04-016-s03-00.png	This Shamir helps
d04-016-s03-01.png	us earthly creatures to build an Altar
d04-016-s03-02.png	for God to come nearer to God .
d04-021-s00-00.png	The action of the Shamir writes books and their
d04-021-s00-01.png	books are readable .
d04-021-s01-00.png	This Shamir is indeed a rare
d04-021-s01-01.png	diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest
d04-021-s01-02.png	facts .
d04-021-s02-00.png	And these creatures existed from the
d04-021-s02-01.png	beginning .
d04-021-s03-00.png	It is the stone , which the builders
d04-021-s03-01.png	refused , but it is to become the head-stone
d04-021-s03-02.png	of the corner .
d04-021-s04-00.png	( Ps. 118 , 22 . )
d04-021-s05-00.png	And the stone shall
d04-021-s05-01.png	tell !
d04-028-s00-00.png	 For the stone shall cry out of the wall , like
d04-028-s00-01.png	Baalam's ass , and the purlin of timber shall
d04-028-s00-02.png	creak in answer if the roof of our security is
d04-028-s00-03.png	crushing our soul ( see Hab. 2 , 10-11 ) .
d04-028-s01-00.png	And it is
d04-028-s01-01.png	through the Shamir : That the earth shall be
d04-028-s01-02.png	filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the
d04-028-s01-03.png	Lord , as the waters cover the sea . 
d04-028-s02-00.png	( Hab. 2 , 14 . )
d04-032-s00-00.png	The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue ,
d04-032-s00-01.png	which is written on two plates , the hard facts
d04-032-s00-02.png	of life , and all facts are one .
d04-032-s01-00.png	We have all
d04-032-s01-01.png	come across human Shamirs and they leave
d04-032-s01-02.png	a deep impression on our feelings and senses .
d04-032-s02-00.png	They make us the Altar for God to emit
d04-032-s02-01.png	the Light which can be read in every
d04-032-s02-02.png	language .
d04-032-s03-00.png	The Shamir is the seventh and
d04-032-s03-01.png	most important creature , that was created on
d04-032-s03-02.png	the eve of the Sabbath , to bring the
d04-032-s03-03.png	Sabbath , real peace to the whole world .
d04-037-s00-00.png	Then the whole earth will be His Altar .
d04-037-s01-00.png	 And it
d04-037-s01-01.png	shall come to pass , if 1ye shall 1hearken
d04-037-s01-02.png	diligently unto my commandments , which I command
d04-037-s01-03.png	you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to
d04-037-s01-04.png	serve Him with all your heart and with all
d04-037-s01-05.png	your soul . 
d04-037-s02-00.png	This may seem very good , but there
d04-037-s02-01.png	is something deficient .
d04-047-s00-00.png	Under such conditions without putting your
d04-047-s00-01.png	mind together we cannot solve the further
d04-047-s00-02.png	summons of destiny , to solve the economic
d04-047-s00-03.png	problems .
d04-047-s01-00.png	Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
d04-047-s01-01.png	Jochai ( Tanis 6a ) if Israel does not fulfil
d04-047-s01-02.png	the wish of the Lord , failing to serve the
d04-047-s01-03.png	Lord God with all their visionary power ,
d04-047-s01-04.png	the work will have to be done by each
d04-047-s01-05.png	individual .
d04-050-s00-00.png	They will not work in union .
d04-050-s01-00.png	If physical power , spiritual power
d04-050-s01-01.png	and visionary power is not united , man will remain in his heart
d04-050-s01-02.png	selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
d04-050-s01-03.png	gratify selfish aims , then each man will gather-in
d04-050-s01-04.png	for himself only , instead of all to help to gather your
d04-050-s01-05.png	corn , your wine and your oil .
d04-053-s00-00.png	Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
d04-053-s00-01.png	freedom from fear , fear of starvation in the
d04-053-s00-02.png	midst of plenty .
d04-053-s01-00.png	Help will not be easily forth-
d04-053-s01-01.png	coming for the people in need .
d04-053-s02-00.png	They will
d04-053-s02-01.png	think of the animals first ( which is of course
d04-053-s02-02.png	our duty ) .
d04-053-s03-00.png	Of course the individual will
d04-053-s03-01.png	eat and be full but : Take heed to yourself ,
d04-053-s03-02.png	that your heart be not deceived , and 1ye turn
d04-053-s03-03.png	aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ,
d04-053-s03-04.png	the yourself is thy greatest enemy , the self-
d04-053-s03-05.png	seeking self .
d04-058-s00-00.png	And you serve Mammon and God .
d04-058-s01-00.png	And you cannot serve
d04-058-s01-01.png	two masters , and you worship self-interest , isolating
d04-058-s01-02.png	yourself , under such conditions the goods are your gods .
d04-058-s02-00.png	 And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you , and he
d04-058-s02-01.png	shut up the heavens , that there is no rain , and that the land
d04-058-s02-02.png	yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from off the
d04-058-s02-03.png	good land which the Lord 1giveth you . 
d04-062-s00-00.png	For without the vision to serve the Lord your God with all
d04-062-s00-01.png	your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
d04-062-s00-02.png	the problem of life cannot be solved .
d04-062-s01-00.png	 Therefore shall 1ye lay
d04-062-s01-01.png	up these my words in your heart and in your soul . 
d04-062-s02-00.png	The text
d04-062-s02-01.png	adds and in your soul , searching your soul .
d04-066-s00-00.png	And the sequence in the text is different than
d04-066-s00-01.png	in the first part of the Shmah , we have first and
d04-066-s00-02.png	to bind them for a sign upon your hand , that
d04-066-s00-03.png	they may be as frontlets between your eyes . 
d04-066-s01-00.png	First to
d04-066-s01-01.png	bind them to have the vision and then
d04-066-s02-00.png	 And 1ye
d04-066-s02-01.png	shall teach them to your children . 
d04-066-s03-00.png	And as we have go-
d04-066-s03-01.png	ne through the mill , we need not teach them
d04-066-s03-02.png	to the children any more diligently and the
d04-066-s03-03.png	children will grasp now what will befall
d04-066-s03-04.png	them without visionary power .
d04-071-s00-00.png	And we will nail the Divine Law on the
d04-071-s00-01.png	door posts of the house and upon the gates .
d04-071-s01-00.png	 That your days may be multiplied and the
d04-071-s01-01.png	days of your children in the land , which
d04-071-s01-02.png	the Lord swear unto your father to give them ,
d04-071-s01-03.png	as days of HEAVEN ON EARTH 
d04-071-s02-00.png	That
d04-071-s02-01.png	means the Kingdom of Messianic Righteousness
d04-071-s02-02.png	( Talmud Sanh. 99A ) .
d04-075-s00-00.png	The Messusah , which is nailed on the doorposts
d04-075-s00-01.png	contains those two lessons .
d04-075-s01-00.png	The third lesson
d04-075-s01-01.png	of the Shmah ( Numbers 15 , 37-41 ) is
d04-075-s01-02.png	called the going-out of the land of
d04-075-s01-03.png	Egypt .
d04-075-s02-00.png	It starts with the story of the fringes
d04-075-s02-01.png	the tsitsits .
d04-075-s03-00.png	This lesson used to be read
d04-075-s03-01.png	only in the morning .
d04-075-s04-00.png	And the Talmud tells a
d04-075-s04-01.png	story , which is also in the Hagadah that
d04-075-s04-02.png	Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said , I am
d04-075-s04-03.png	nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that
d04-081-s00-00.png	Ben Zoma said :
d04-081-s01-00.png	 The days of 1thy life
d04-081-s01-01.png	means in the day-time ; all the days of
d04-081-s01-02.png	1thy life means even at night-time . 
d04-081-s02-00.png	( Berochoth . )
d04-081-s03-00.png	And the Rabbis thought
d04-081-s03-01.png	it important that when we read the
d04-081-s03-02.png	Shmah to be willing to hear , we
d04-081-s03-03.png	should remember the Great
d04-081-s03-04.png	Deliverance : Passover and its connection
d04-081-s03-05.png	with the fringes ( the tsitsits ) .
d04-086-s00-00.png	And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots
d04-086-s00-01.png	just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which
d04-086-s00-02.png	are used on Passover , to depict the time of our freedom .
d04-086-s01-00.png	And they are ( 1 ) Matzo ; ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs ; ( 3 ) Salt-water and
d04-086-s01-01.png	Charauses ( a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the
d04-086-s01-02.png	appearance of mortar ) ; and ( 4 ) an attitude to lean
d04-086-s01-03.png	back .
d04-089-s00-00.png	( 1 ) Matzos is deficient bread , ( LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew ) ,
d04-089-s00-01.png	so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge , and to
d04-089-s00-02.png	cure our mental incapacity we should be willing
d04-089-s00-03.png	to learn .
d04-089-s01-00.png	Education is always the most important task .
d04-089-s02-00.png	Education gives : Freedom of Speech .
d04-089-s03-00.png	( 2 ) Bitter Herbs
d04-089-s03-01.png	symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us .
d04-089-s04-00.png	We eat it .
d04-089-s05-00.png	We accept it , to show we have self-control
d04-089-s05-01.png	and that God dwells within us .
d04-096-s00-00.png	Self-control gives us : Freedom to worship God .
d04-096-s01-00.png	( 3 ) Salt Water and Charauses :
d04-096-s01-01.png	the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah
d04-096-s01-02.png	( MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew , Salt is the covenant of 1thy God ,
d04-096-s01-03.png	Levit. 2 , 13 . )
d04-096-s02-00.png	Salt preserves and we should have this salt in
d04-096-s02-01.png	ourselves and have peace with one-another .
d04-096-s03-00.png	And the sweet
d04-096-s03-01.png	Mortar ( the CHARAUSES in Hebrew ) that binds all the hard-
d04-096-s03-02.png	facts together and explains them , represents the Oral
d04-096-s03-03.png	Tradition .
d04-101-s00-00.png	We dip into both , at the Seder .
d04-101-s01-00.png	And we want to understand
d04-101-s01-01.png	more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition , our inheritance .
d04-101-s02-00.png	Living the life of the Torah ( dipping-in ) makes us
d04-101-s02-01.png	meek :
d04-101-s03-00.png	 But the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall
d04-101-s03-01.png	delight themselves in the abundance of Peace ( Psalm 37 ,
d04-101-s03-02.png	11 ) .
d04-101-s04-00.png	That gives us freedom from want .
d04-111-s00-00.png	( 1 ) Matzo represents Peshat ; ( 2 ) Moraur
d04-111-s00-01.png	represents Remez ; ( 3 ) Dipping-in represents
d04-111-s00-02.png	Derush ; ( 4 ) Leaning-back represents Saud .
d04-111-s01-00.png	( This is the PARDUS . )
d04-111-s02-00.png	Matzo represents
d04-111-s02-01.png	the literal meaning of Pesach which
d04-111-s02-02.png	is called : The Feast of Matzos .
d04-111-s03-00.png	The
d04-111-s03-01.png	Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual
d04-111-s03-02.png	principle and this gives us a wink ( Remez )
d04-111-s03-03.png	how to live and accept all the bitterness
d04-111-s03-04.png	that is hurled against us .
d04-111-s04-00.png	The Salt-water
d04-111-s04-01.png	and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents
d04-111-s04-02.png	the richness of the Law and that we should
d04-117-s00-00.png	Leaning back carries the concealed message .
d04-117-s01-00.png	And we
d04-117-s01-01.png	start the Seder showing the Matzos , that they rep-
d04-117-s01-02.png	resent the Bread of Poverty which our fore-fathers
d04-117-s01-03.png	were eating in Mitzrajim , to show they were willing to learn ;
d04-117-s01-04.png	and we invite anybody who wishes to partake in our
d04-117-s01-05.png	discussions , saying :
d04-117-s02-00.png	 Anybody who is hungry , let him come
d04-117-s02-01.png	and eat , Anybody who is thirsty , let him come and
d04-117-s02-02.png	drink . 
d04-121-s00-00.png	And we want all to eat and drink His Great Philosophy of the
d04-121-s00-01.png	four ways of Israel's redemption .
d04-121-s01-00.png	Hence four questions , which are
d04-121-s01-01.png	really interrogations to examine into the principles of the four re-
d04-121-s01-02.png	demptions are asked at the Seder-evening about these four
d04-121-s01-03.png	symbols ( the MANISHTANO ) .
d04-121-s02-00.png	And the person who asks these
d04-121-s02-01.png	questions is seeking the opinion of the one who is
d04-121-s02-02.png	conducting the Seder .
d04-125-s00-00.png	And we answer , that the Lord our God gave us four freedoms 
d04-125-s00-01.png	without which Society cannot make progress .
d04-125-s01-00.png	And we drink
d04-125-s01-01.png	 four cups to thank the Lord our God for the four
d04-125-s01-02.png	freedoms which are Divine .
d04-125-s02-00.png	There are four ways of
d04-125-s02-01.png	redemption :
d04-125-s03-00.png	( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
d04-125-s03-01.png	burdens of Egypt .
d04-125-s04-00.png	( 2 ) I will rid you of their bondage .
d04-131-s00-00.png	( 3 ) I will redeem you .
d04-131-s01-00.png	( 4 ) I will take you to me for a
d04-131-s01-01.png	people .
d04-131-s02-00.png	( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
d04-131-s02-01.png	burdens of Egypt :
d04-131-s03-00.png	How was it that Israel was
d04-131-s03-01.png	brought out from under the burdens of Egypt ?
d04-131-s04-00.png	Because , they kept the Passover and they were
d04-131-s04-01.png	eating Matzos in Egypt and the Feast of Matzos 
d04-131-s04-02.png	was known even to Abraham and Lot .
d05-008-s00-00.png	The new century opened with James 1 ascending
d05-008-s00-01.png	the throne .
d05-008-s01-00.png	He was quite prepared to be
d05-008-s01-01.png	tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
d05-008-s01-02.png	spoiled that .
d05-008-s02-00.png	The Puritans had high hopes , for
d05-008-s02-01.png	James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,
d05-008-s02-02.png	but those hopes were dashed .
d05-008-s03-00.png	True , a new Prayer
d05-008-s03-01.png	Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
d05-008-s03-02.png	derived little comfort from it .
d05-013-s00-00.png	They objected to the word Absolution .
d05-013-s01-00.png	So the phrase ' or
d05-013-s01-01.png	the remission of sins ' was added .
d05-013-s02-00.png	But Absolution remained .
d05-013-s03-00.png	They objected to the word Confirmation .
d05-013-s04-00.png	So the phrase
d05-013-s04-01.png	' or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and
d05-013-s04-02.png	able to render an account of their faith according
d05-013-s04-03.png	to the Catechism following ' were added .
d05-013-s05-00.png	But Confirmation
d05-013-s05-01.png	remained .
d05-013-s06-00.png	Other changes in the Book were equally
d05-013-s06-01.png	minor except for the new section on the Sacraments
d05-013-s06-02.png	added to the Catechism .
d05-021-s00-00.png	This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
d05-021-s00-01.png	been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for
d05-021-s00-02.png	it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are
d05-021-s00-03.png	verily and indeed taken and received by the
d05-021-s00-04.png	faithful in the Lord's Supper . '
d05-021-s01-00.png	It could hardly be more
d05-021-s01-01.png	definite .
d05-021-s02-00.png	It was at this time , too , that King James made
d05-021-s02-01.png	himself immortal by becoming associated with
d05-021-s02-02.png	a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
d05-021-s02-03.png	( which was never actually authorized ! ) .
d05-025-s00-00.png	In that year Shakespeare had just turned
d05-025-s00-01.png	forty and had written Hamlet two years
d05-025-s00-02.png	before .
d05-025-s01-00.png	Bacon was at work and Milton was
d05-025-s01-01.png	just learning to read .
d05-025-s02-00.png	James was followed by
d05-025-s02-01.png	Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish
d05-025-s02-02.png	Prayer Book in 1637 .
d05-025-s03-00.png	Significantly this made
d05-025-s03-01.png	a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
d05-025-s03-02.png	became the foster mother of some of the most
d05-025-s03-03.png	important Prayer Books in the Anglican
d05-025-s03-04.png	Communion .
d05-030-s00-00.png	Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,
d05-030-s00-01.png	now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05-030-s00-02.png	led us to believe .
d05-030-s01-00.png	Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05-030-s01-01.png	by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was
d05-030-s01-02.png	mutual .
d05-030-s02-00.png	But Laud was no Romanizer .
d05-030-s03-00.png	One of his
d05-030-s03-01.png	first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05-030-s03-02.png	the Jesuit , Fisher .
d05-030-s04-00.png	But anyone who was friendly
d05-030-s04-01.png	with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,
d05-030-s04-02.png	was necessarily a menace .
d05-040-s00-00.png	Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church ?
d05-040-s01-00.png	Laud made a positive approach .
d05-040-s02-00.png	He set out to increase
d05-040-s02-01.png	a sense of reverence .
d05-040-s03-00.png	The Prayer Book was to be respected
d05-040-s03-01.png	and so was the office of a bishop .
d05-040-s04-00.png	Altars should be
d05-040-s04-01.png	altars and not any broken down , transportable
d05-040-s04-02.png	table which was handy for the most improbable uses .
d06-000-s00-00.png	In the first place it is not a great deal
d06-000-s00-01.png	of use telling even children , as I have
d06-000-s00-02.png	already suggested , not to be silly or
d06-000-s00-03.png	to pull themselves together .
d06-000-s01-00.png	Far better
d06-000-s01-01.png	to help them to face whatever it is that
d06-000-s01-02.png	is worrying them , to find the original
d06-000-s01-03.png	cause and then deal with it ; show it
d06-000-s01-04.png	up either for the sham it is - and many
d06-000-s01-05.png	fears are based upon completely
d06-000-s01-06.png	irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
d06-003-s00-00.png	Even worse is to laugh .
d06-003-s01-00.png	Tremendous damage may be done to a child
d06-003-s01-01.png	by laughing at what are very real fears .
d06-003-s02-00.png	As adults , we know
d06-003-s02-01.png	that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,
d06-003-s02-02.png	but to a child they are very real .
d06-003-s03-00.png	Not that I am suggesting
d06-003-s03-01.png	that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
d06-003-s03-02.png	to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the
d06-003-s03-03.png	other side as victors .
d06-008-s00-00.png	To ridicule them only pushes them farther
d06-008-s00-01.png	into themselves , so that they become
d06-008-s00-02.png	unable to speak about it to anybody and
d06-008-s00-03.png	the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,
d06-008-s00-04.png	the harvest of which may still be being
d06-008-s00-05.png	reaped at forty or fifty .
d06-008-s01-00.png	Far better to
d06-008-s01-01.png	agree with a child that a particular
d06-008-s01-02.png	situation is frightening , and then to face
d06-008-s01-03.png	it together until the child can see how
d06-008-s01-04.png	unnecessary its fears were .
d06-011-s00-00.png	Because situations which may contain
d06-011-s00-01.png	all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,
d06-011-s00-02.png	it is a good idea to condition a child
d06-011-s00-03.png	to some extent against it .
d06-011-s01-00.png	To keep a child
d06-011-s01-01.png	of twelve or thirteen under the
d06-011-s01-02.png	impression that nothing nasty ever
d06-011-s01-03.png	happens is not merely dishonest , it
d06-011-s01-04.png	is unwise .
d06-011-s02-00.png	As I shall suggest in a
d06-011-s02-01.png	later chapter there are some situations
d06-011-s02-02.png	which occur less frequently than
d06-015-s00-00.png	A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into
d06-015-s00-01.png	too many details , would help many a child to make a
d06-015-s00-02.png	proper adjustment to life as it grows up .
d06-015-s01-00.png	Let us look
d06-015-s01-01.png	at Jesus .
d06-015-s02-00.png	We do not , I think , see there a life without fear .
d06-015-s03-00.png	There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
d06-015-s03-01.png	on .
d06-020-s00-00.png	In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
d06-020-s00-01.png	should pass from Him .
d06-020-s01-00.png	Jesus shows us
d06-020-s01-01.png	the way to face life .
d06-020-s02-00.png	To see all the latent
d06-020-s02-01.png	frightening possibilities and yet by facing
d06-020-s02-02.png	them and knowing God is with us and
d06-020-s02-03.png	that , with Him , there is nothing that can
d06-020-s02-04.png	finally defeat us .
d06-020-s03-00.png	More than that , that God
d06-020-s03-01.png	has something important to do with our
d06-020-s03-02.png	lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,
d06-020-s03-03.png	the stronger we become .
d06-025-s00-00.png	... Today A wonderful thought In the
d06-025-s00-01.png	dawn was given ... And the thought
d06-025-s00-02.png	Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
d06-025-s00-03.png	my hand ; That my hand is big Big ,
d06-025-s00-04.png	Because of the plan That God , Who
d06-025-s00-05.png	dwells in my hand , Knows this
d06-025-s00-06.png	secret plan , Of the things He will
d06-025-s00-07.png	do for the world Using my hand .
d06-027-s00-00.png	Toyohiko Kagawa .
d06-027-s01-00.png	Loving Saviour , who experienced
d06-027-s01-01.png	all human emotion , and whose sensitive
d06-027-s01-02.png	nature knows better than we do , what it is to
d06-027-s01-03.png	be really afraid , help us to know that when
d06-027-s01-04.png	we face life boldly , many of the shadows are
d06-027-s01-05.png	seen to be allies and not enemies and that ,
d06-027-s01-06.png	come what may , we are never alone when
d06-027-s01-07.png	we are with Thee .
d06-030-s00-00.png	Amen .
d06-030-s01-00.png	MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
d06-030-s01-01.png	purely physical thing .
d06-030-s02-00.png	The cure for which is sleep .
d06-030-s03-00.png	This is only
d06-030-s03-01.png	partly true .
d06-030-s04-00.png	Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
d06-030-s04-01.png	amount of rest seems to make any difference .
d06-030-s05-00.png	Sleep , to be
d06-030-s05-01.png	effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes
d06-030-s05-02.png	from innocence .
d06-037-s00-00.png	To others , the long hours of the night bring
d06-037-s00-01.png	only a disturbed tossing and turning
d06-037-s00-02.png	which causes them to wake feeling worse
d06-037-s00-03.png	than when they went to bed .
d06-037-s01-00.png	We may begin
d06-037-s01-01.png	to understand this a little better when we
d06-037-s01-02.png	realize that tiredness itself is largely in
d06-037-s01-03.png	the mind .
d06-037-s02-00.png	Very few people , under normal
d06-037-s02-01.png	conditions , work themselves to a standstill .
d06-041-s00-00.png	The mind tires first and conveys the impression
d06-041-s00-01.png	of tiredness to the body .
d06-041-s01-00.png	This can be proved by
d06-041-s01-01.png	noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
d06-041-s01-02.png	body who feels thoroughly tired .
d06-041-s02-00.png	Suppose
d06-041-s02-01.png	a mother has news late at night that her
d06-041-s02-02.png	child is in danger .
d06-041-s03-00.png	She will undertake a
d06-041-s03-01.png	journey which , an hour before , she would
d06-041-s03-02.png	have declared impossible .
d06-046-s00-00.png	Even more simply , test your own reactions
d06-046-s00-01.png	to different situations .
d06-046-s01-00.png	There are some which
d06-046-s01-01.png	bring on an almost immediate feeling of
d06-046-s01-02.png	tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
d06-046-s01-03.png	the washing-up - while others , if they
d06-046-s01-04.png	refer to something you like doing , bring a
d06-046-s01-05.png	veritable surge of energy .
d06-046-s02-00.png	Many a girl who
d06-046-s02-01.png	is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
d06-046-s02-02.png	up with no apparent tiredness at all when
d06-046-s02-03.png	her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
d06-050-s00-00.png	Nor is she necessarily being deceitful .
d06-050-s01-00.png	She really did feel tired
d06-050-s01-01.png	until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
d06-050-s01-02.png	attractive - interest !
d06-050-s02-00.png	Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do
d06-050-s02-01.png	with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion .
d06-050-s03-00.png	A
d06-050-s03-01.png	disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
d06-050-s03-02.png	of fatigue .
d06-050-s04-00.png	They wonder why they get no rest at night ,
d06-050-s04-01.png	even if they do sleep .
d06-056-s00-00.png	They drag themselves around and can become
d06-056-s00-01.png	a burden to their families and their friends .
d06-056-s01-00.png	Any mental confusion can cause this and
d06-056-s01-01.png	the best way is probably to seek advice .
d06-056-s02-00.png	As we are unable to cure our own bodies
d06-056-s02-01.png	if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,
d06-056-s02-02.png	so we are unable to cure our own minds ,
d06-056-s02-03.png	if the trouble is a complicated one
d06-056-s02-04.png	involving careful and patient treatment .
d06-060-s00-00.png	One of the greatest steps forward that has been
d06-060-s00-01.png	made this century is the way in which illness
d06-060-s00-02.png	of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,
d06-060-s00-03.png	and is in fact no differently regarded than
d06-060-s00-04.png	physical illness .
d06-060-s01-00.png	There is , nevertheless , a
d06-060-s01-01.png	great deal of tiredness which comes from
d06-060-s01-02.png	no major complication but results from an
d06-060-s01-03.png	inability to deal with life , especially under
d06-060-s01-04.png	the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
d06-060-s01-05.png	century .
d06-063-s00-00.png	In the days when most people were born ,
d06-063-s00-01.png	lived and died within the boundaries of
d06-063-s00-02.png	the village , it was not difficult for anybody
d06-063-s00-03.png	to live a day at a time .
d06-063-s01-00.png	Even those who
d06-063-s01-01.png	held a high and responsible office lived in
d06-063-s01-02.png	far greater simplicity than their successors .
d06-063-s02-00.png	When news from the Continent took days ,
d06-063-s02-01.png	from America weeks , from the Far East ,
d06-063-s02-02.png	months , even a Prime Minister could go to
d06-063-s02-03.png	sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
d06-063-s02-04.png	be happening at the other end of England ,
d06-067-s00-00.png	In other ways , too , life for the ordinary
d06-067-s00-01.png	individual has become so complex
d06-067-s00-02.png	that it taxes the mind .
d06-067-s01-00.png	Two hundred
d06-067-s01-01.png	years ago , men lived and worked
d06-067-s01-02.png	in one place , their lives were of one
d06-067-s01-03.png	piece .
d06-067-s02-00.png	Now a man may live twenty ,
d06-067-s02-01.png	thirty even sixty miles from his
d06-067-s02-02.png	work .
d06-067-s03-00.png	The only connexion is the
d06-067-s03-01.png	pipeline of the railway on which they
d06-067-s03-02.png	travel day by day .
d06-072-s00-00.png	In many cases , their homes know little of
d06-072-s00-01.png	their place of work and their associates at
d06-072-s00-02.png	the office or works wonder what they
d06-072-s00-03.png	are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06-072-s00-04.png	homes .
d06-072-s01-00.png	It is easy , desperately easy , to lead
d06-072-s01-01.png	a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06-072-s01-02.png	planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06-072-s01-03.png	of what is going on .
d06-072-s02-00.png	It is easier to live life in
d06-072-s02-01.png	compartments but over the years it builds up ,
d06-072-s02-02.png	and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06-072-s02-03.png	need to be handled correctly .
d06-076-s00-00.png	Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
d06-076-s00-01.png	as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un-
d06-076-s00-02.png	necessary weariness .
d06-076-s01-00.png	( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness .
d06-076-s02-00.png	We have a saying
d06-076-s03-00.png	' My head will never save my feet ' .
d06-076-s04-00.png	Time
d06-076-s04-01.png	after time we forget something and have to go back
d06-076-s04-02.png	upstairs or down to the shops .
d06-082-s00-00.png	If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -
d06-082-s00-01.png	we lose this way in the course of a day we would be
d06-082-s00-02.png	staggered .
d06-082-s01-00.png	Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to
d06-082-s01-01.png	become too pernickety .
d06-082-s02-00.png	Nevertheless , we could all probably
d06-082-s02-01.png	be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle
d06-082-s02-02.png	through .
d06-086-s00-00.png	The housewife would find life far less tiring
d06-086-s00-01.png	if she made a list , followed a routine of work
d06-086-s00-02.png	rather than getting from one thing to the next .
d06-086-s01-00.png	The business man would find that he reached
d06-086-s01-01.png	the end of the day with far less strain if
d06-086-s01-02.png	he was a little more systematic .
d06-086-s02-00.png	To drift
d06-086-s02-01.png	aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
d06-086-s02-02.png	thing else .
d06-086-s03-00.png	If we would only sit down and
d06-086-s03-01.png	write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
d06-086-s03-02.png	be done and then work quietly through them ,
d06-086-s03-03.png	we would find life considerably less exhausting
d06-091-s00-00.png	There may be some who will argue that
d06-091-s00-01.png	routine destroys the soul .
d06-091-s01-00.png	It is so easy ,
d06-091-s01-01.png	they say , to get into a rut .
d06-091-s02-00.png	Save us
d06-091-s02-01.png	from the school curriculum and even
d06-091-s02-02.png	worse the school system whereby for
d06-091-s02-03.png	meals everybody knows beforehand
d06-091-s02-04.png	exactly what , on any given day of the
d06-091-s02-05.png	week , they are going to have .
d06-091-s03-00.png	If - such
d06-091-s03-01.png	a critic may say - you are calling
d06-091-s03-02.png	us to adventure , do not strangle us before
d06-091-s03-03.png	we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
d06-096-s00-00.png	I am more than conscious of this .
d06-096-s01-00.png	How anybody
d06-096-s01-01.png	can go through the same routine day in and day
d06-096-s01-02.png	out for forty years I find difficult to understand .
d06-096-s02-00.png	A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and
d06-096-s02-01.png	commerce may be kept going - though if ever
d06-096-s02-02.png	it becomes possible to work out a system
d06-096-s02-03.png	of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense
d06-096-s02-04.png	amount of good over and above relieving
d06-096-s02-05.png	the pressure on over-crowded trains .
d06-100-s00-00.png	As it is , with so much of our life already
d06-100-s00-01.png	in a predetermined groove , I would
d06-100-s00-02.png	hardly like to add further to the dullness
d06-100-s00-03.png	which it engenders .
d06-100-s01-00.png	But I am not arguing
d06-100-s01-01.png	for this .
d06-100-s02-00.png	I know how much of a drag it can be
d06-100-s02-01.png	and I was interested some little while
d06-100-s02-02.png	ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
d06-100-s02-03.png	day timetable .
d06-104-s00-00.png	They only worked , of course , a five-
d06-104-s00-01.png	day week so that in the first week
d06-104-s00-02.png	Monday to Friday were days one
d06-104-s00-03.png	to five of the timetable , the following
d06-104-s00-04.png	Monday was day six and Tuesday
d06-104-s00-05.png	started day one again and so on .
d06-104-s01-00.png	By this means they avoided each
d06-104-s01-01.png	week being the same with a pupil
d06-104-s01-02.png	knowing exactly what the subject
d06-104-s01-03.png	would be on Friday afternoon at
d06-104-s01-04.png	3 p.m. .
d06-107-s00-00.png	It was a little complicated to work ,
d06-107-s00-01.png	of course , and there had to be a big
d06-107-s00-02.png	notice in the entrance saying which
d06-107-s00-03.png	day of the timetable it was - but
d06-107-s00-04.png	it added immensely to the interest
d06-107-s00-05.png	and kept everybody on their toes .
d06-107-s01-00.png	To have order does not mean getting
d06-107-s01-01.png	into a dull routine .
d06-107-s02-00.png	I have great
d06-107-s02-01.png	sympathy with the young wife
d06-107-s02-02.png	who does not always want to do
d06-107-s02-03.png	the washing on a Monday .
d06-111-s00-00.png	I would not want to either , but if she wants to get through
d06-111-s00-01.png	the day without becoming exhausted , she will be well advised to
d06-111-s00-02.png	sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
d06-111-s00-03.png	do , note the order in which they can most conveniently be
d06-111-s00-04.png	done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors
d06-111-s00-05.png	- you must , for example , do your shopping on the morning of
d06-111-s00-06.png	the early closing day ) .
d06-113-s00-00.png	She will , in fact , be surprised at what peace
d06-113-s00-01.png	of mind ensues .
d06-113-s01-00.png	( b ) Concentrate on one
d06-113-s01-01.png	thing at a time .
d06-113-s02-00.png	A list or a plan enables us to
d06-113-s02-01.png	put all our energies into the particular
d06-113-s02-02.png	matter on hand .
d07-082-s00-00.png	( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof
d07-082-s00-01.png	texts and the Gemara explains why these ,
d07-082-s00-02.png	too , are necessary , but a careful examination
d07-082-s00-03.png	of that passage makes it clear that these are
d07-082-s00-04.png	not quoted here because they are not
d07-082-s00-05.png	necessary to prove the point made by
d07-082-s00-06.png	R. Joshua b. Levi . )
d07-082-s01-00.png	Finally , we note that
d07-082-s01-01.png	the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
d07-082-s01-02.png	elsewhere .
d07-085-s00-00.png	From the above it follows that here , once again ,
d07-085-s00-01.png	we have a good illustration of how a
d07-085-s00-02.png	sugya has been fashioned from material
d07-085-s00-03.png	already in the hands of the Redactors .
d07-085-s01-00.png	The sugya is built around the saying of
d07-085-s01-01.png	R. Joshua b. Levi .
d07-085-s02-00.png	The proof text for the
d07-085-s02-01.png	reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
d07-085-s02-02.png	with the comment given by Samuel .
d07-089-s00-00.png	( This is probably to be understood as a well-
d07-089-s00-01.png	known comment on the verse ; quoted by
d07-089-s00-02.png	Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
d07-089-s00-03.png	by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
d07-089-s00-04.png	Levi's thesis ! )
d07-089-s01-00.png	The proof text of greeting by
d07-089-s01-01.png	the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
d07-089-s02-00.png	There is no reference to the Mishnah here
d07-089-s02-01.png	because the Mishnah deals with the
d07-089-s02-02.png	actual practice of greeting by the divine
d07-089-s02-03.png	Name and the Gemara here quotes the
d07-089-s02-04.png	texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
d07-093-s00-00.png	The question and answer with regard to the
d07-093-s00-01.png	need for the text of the angel are quoted
d07-093-s00-02.png	here in the same words in which they are
d07-093-s00-03.png	quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
d07-093-s01-00.png	This can either mean that both sugyas are
d07-093-s01-01.png	quoting a well-known question and
d07-093-s01-02.png	answer or that our sugya is quoting from
d07-093-s01-03.png	the longer sugya which deals with all
d07-093-s01-04.png	four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
d07-096-s00-00.png	Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
d07-096-s00-01.png	original question and answer and this is quoted
d07-096-s00-02.png	in the other sugya .
d07-096-s01-00.png	( This can be supported by the
d07-096-s01-01.png	use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own
d07-096-s01-02.png	accord but there was no approval of his action
d07-096-s01-03.png	in Heaven ' in both sugyoth .
d07-096-s02-00.png	Such an
d07-096-s02-01.png	expression appears to have been framed in
d07-096-s02-02.png	response to the particular point at issue here ,
d07-096-s02-03.png	whether the Heavenly Court concurred
d07-096-s02-04.png	in the decision of the human court . )
d07-100-s00-00.png	The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
d07-100-s00-01.png	is then quoted and the interpretation of the
d07-100-s00-02.png	latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
d07-100-s00-03.png	is added , not because this is at all relevant
d07-100-s00-04.png	to the discussion but because it was
d07-100-s00-05.png	a familiar interpretation which had
d07-100-s00-06.png	become so well known that it was
d07-100-s00-07.png	invariably quoted whenever the verse
d07-100-s00-08.png	itself was quoted , almost as if it were a
d07-100-s00-09.png	part of the verse .
d07-102-s00-00.png	The Gemara continues with a saying of the
d07-102-s00-01.png	Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) :
d07-102-s01-00.png	' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
d07-102-s01-01.png	the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,
d07-102-s01-02.png	and the court of Solomon . '
d07-102-s02-00.png	The place of this
d07-102-s02-01.png	saying here is obvious , it follows naturally
d07-102-s02-02.png	on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
d07-102-s02-03.png	deals with a similar theme .
e01-014-s00-00.png	We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
e01-014-s00-01.png	that he was a great man for lace - paying
e01-014-s00-02.png	as much as 3 for a lace collar .
e01-014-s01-00.png	But this
e01-014-s01-01.png	didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
e01-014-s01-02.png	for his lady , for he records testily :
e01-014-s02-00.png	' My wife
e01-014-s02-01.png	and I fell out about my not being willing
e01-014-s02-02.png	to have her gown laced . '
e01-018-s00-00.png	We read , with sympathy , an advertisement in the
e01-018-s00-01.png	reign of Charles 2 stating :
e01-018-s01-00.png	' Lost : a lawn 1hand-
e01-018-s01-01.png	kercher with a broad hem laced round with
e01-018-s01-02.png	fine Point lace about four fingers broad ' and
e01-018-s01-03.png	among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
e01-018-s01-04.png	unpaid bill for ' scarlet satin shoes with
e01-018-s01-05.png	silver lace ' .
e01-018-s02-00.png	The records of these tender trifles
e01-018-s02-01.png	are very touching but then lace does place
e01-018-s02-02.png	upon everything a delicate sentiment .
e01-022-s00-00.png	Lucky indeed are the families that
e01-022-s00-01.png	possess a heritage of lace .
e01-022-s01-00.png	A lace
e01-022-s01-01.png	bridal veil handed down from mother
e01-022-s01-02.png	to daughters , a lace-trimmed Christening
e01-022-s01-03.png	robe that each generation wears in turn -
e01-022-s01-04.png	these are proud possessions , linked to the
e01-022-s01-05.png	exquisite lace-making of the past .
e01-025-s00-00.png	But lace-making is by no means a lost
e01-025-s00-01.png	art .
e01-025-s01-00.png	It suffered a decline and fell into
e01-025-s01-01.png	lamentably low standards in the fussy
e01-025-s01-02.png	over-furnishing of the Victorian age
e01-025-s01-03.png	but it would take more than a temporary
e01-025-s01-04.png	lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely ,
e01-025-s01-05.png	viable craft .
e01-025-s02-00.png	It has , in fact , readily
e01-025-s02-01.png	adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill-
e01-025-s02-02.png	ustrations in the following pages will show
e01-025-s02-03.png	how completely it is in sympathy with con-
e01-025-s02-04.png	temporary surroundings .
e01-029-s00-00.png	It will be seen how , with bold design
e01-029-s00-01.png	and rich colour , knitting , crochet and
e01-029-s00-02.png	tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons
e01-029-s00-03.png	can give striking individuality to many things
e01-029-s00-04.png	in the home .
e01-029-s01-00.png	Chairbacks , cushions , tablecloths ,
e01-029-s01-01.png	to mention only three - how satisfying it is
e01-029-s01-02.png	to avoid the ready-made in these and by
e01-029-s01-03.png	one's own handiwork produce something
e01-029-s01-04.png	that reflects true creative talent .
e01-032-s00-00.png	The more delicate patterns and finer
e01-032-s00-01.png	threads may be reserved to bring a light
e01-032-s00-02.png	and lovely touch to personal possessions -
e01-032-s00-03.png	a lace border to a handkerchief , fine-lace
e01-032-s00-04.png	insertion on a petticoat or blouse , a tatted edge
e01-032-s00-05.png	to a collar ; these add a charming , feminine
e01-032-s00-06.png	distinction that nothing else can give .
e01-032-s01-00.png	Although we assess lace-making as one of
e01-032-s01-01.png	the feminine skills , a number of the well-loved
e01-032-s01-02.png	traditional patterns that we follow today were ,
e01-032-s01-03.png	in fact , the brain-children of inventive men .
e01-035-s00-00.png	For in the old order of things , men designed
e01-035-s00-01.png	and worked lace as well as women and
e01-035-s00-02.png	special schools were set up to teach lace-
e01-035-s00-03.png	making not only to young girls , but to little
e01-035-s00-04.png	boys as well .
e01-035-s01-00.png	Whole families made their
e01-035-s01-01.png	livelihood by lace-making and consequently
e01-035-s01-02.png	a folklore of song , festival and courtship grew
e01-035-s01-03.png	up around the lace industry .
e01-050-s00-00.png	During the sixteenth century a considerable
e01-050-s00-01.png	amount of crochet was produced in the
e01-050-s00-02.png	convents of Europe .
e01-050-s01-00.png	Without doubt it was the
e01-050-s01-01.png	nuns who carried the craft to Ireland .
e01-050-s02-00.png	There it
e01-050-s02-01.png	was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
e01-050-s02-02.png	form with rosettes , leaves and lace fillings .
e01-050-s03-00.png	During
e01-050-s03-01.png	the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
e01-050-s03-02.png	greatly abused .
e01-055-s00-00.png	One can remember with horror the pictures of the
e01-055-s00-01.png	overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
e01-055-s00-02.png	complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-
e01-055-s00-03.png	piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
e01-055-s00-04.png	numerous other crocheted pieces .
e01-055-s01-00.png	It was some years
e01-055-s01-01.png	after the Victorian period that designers realised
e01-055-s01-02.png	the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was
e01-055-s01-03.png	revived with designs suitable for contemporary
e01-055-s01-04.png	trends .
e01-055-s02-00.png	Crochet today has a variety of uses , and
e01-055-s02-01.png	has even stepped into the field of high fashion .
e01-059-s00-00.png	In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris
e01-059-s00-01.png	hand-crocheted blouses , gossamer fine in
e01-059-s00-02.png	texture , are sold at a very high price .
e01-059-s01-00.png	With a
e01-059-s01-01.png	little time and concentration the woman at home can
e01-059-s01-02.png	produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
e01-059-s01-03.png	Paris - a blouse , delicate gloves or a fine
e01-059-s01-04.png	edging for collar , cuffs or a handkerchief .
e01-062-s00-00.png	In the home , crochet lace can be used to make
e01-062-s00-01.png	tablecloths , traycloths and runners , and edgings
e01-062-s00-02.png	from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
e01-062-s00-03.png	functions .
e01-062-s01-00.png	The art of crochet is not difficult and
e01-062-s01-01.png	it is reasonably quick to work .
e01-062-s02-00.png	In the following
e01-062-s02-01.png	pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
e01-062-s02-02.png	to enable the beginner to master all the essential
e01-062-s02-03.png	crochet stitches .
e01-081-s00-00.png	First launder crochet and then pin to the required
e01-081-s00-01.png	shape , ensuring that all lines of the crochet are
e01-081-s00-02.png	accurate .
e01-081-s01-00.png	Place crochet in correct position on linen and
e01-081-s01-01.png	secure with pins .
e01-081-s02-00.png	Run a line of basting stitches
e01-081-s02-01.png	on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
e01-081-s02-02.png	which are to be attached to the linen .
e01-081-s03-00.png	Remove crochet .
e01-086-s00-00.png	Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen :
e01-086-s01-00.png	( a ) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches ,
e01-086-s01-01.png	the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the
e01-086-s01-02.png	outside edge .
e01-086-s02-00.png	Oversew crochet to button stitch .
e01-086-s03-00.png	( b ) Turn under a small hem , with fold lying on line
e01-086-s03-01.png	of basting stitches .
e01-086-s04-00.png	Work a row of dc all round
e01-086-s04-01.png	this hem , with 3 dc at each corner .
e01-092-s00-00.png	Oversew crochet to the dc.
e01-092-s01-00.png	A household word ,
e01-092-s01-01.png	Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which
e01-092-s01-02.png	are of the utmost importance to the worker .
e01-092-s02-00.png	It washes beautifully , never loses its colour
e01-092-s02-01.png	nor becomes ' stringy ' , is very elastic and
e01-092-s02-02.png	preserves the beauty of the design .
e01-092-s03-00.png	It is easy
e01-092-s03-01.png	to work with , soft , glossy and of uniform
e01-092-s03-02.png	thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread .
e01-102-s00-00.png	Remember that texture plays an important part in
e01-102-s00-01.png	the beauty of crochet .
e01-102-s01-00.png	The finer mercerised threads
e01-102-s01-01.png	are more effective for the delicate designs used for
e01-102-s01-02.png	tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while
e01-102-s01-03.png	the heavier threads are used for bedspreads ,
e01-102-s01-04.png	chairbacks , luncheon mats , etc.
e01-102-s02-00.png	Crochet hooks
e01-102-s02-01.png	are made of steel , composition or bone .
e01-102-s03-00.png	Steel
e01-102-s03-01.png	crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0 ,
e01-102-s03-02.png	the largest , to number 8 , the smallest .
e01-107-s00-00.png	Each size of hook is made for use with a certain
e01-107-s00-01.png	size of thread .
e01-107-s01-00.png	To ensure the correct results ,
e01-107-s01-01.png	it is important that you use the size of hook
e01-107-s01-02.png	specified in the directions .
e01-107-s02-00.png	These are the
e01-107-s02-01.png	correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet :
e01-107-s03-00.png	Directions are given for a small practice
e01-107-s03-01.png	piece for each stitch that you learn .
e01-107-s04-00.png	When
e01-107-s04-01.png	you have become proficient in these
e01-107-s04-02.png	stitches , attractive articles can be made
e01-107-s04-03.png	from the directions included in this book .
e01-113-s00-00.png	1 . Grasp thread near end between thumb
e01-113-s00-01.png	and forefinger .
e01-113-s01-00.png	2 . Make a loop by
e01-113-s01-01.png	lapping long thread over short thread .
e01-113-s02-00.png	3 . Hold loop in place between thumb
e01-113-s02-01.png	and forefinger ( Fig. 1 ) .
e01-113-s03-00.png	1 . Take hold
e01-113-s03-01.png	of broad bar of hook as you would a
e01-113-s03-02.png	pencil .
e01-113-s04-00.png	Bring middle finger forward to
e01-113-s04-01.png	rest near tip of hook .
e01-119-s00-00.png	2 . Insert hook through loop and under long
e01-119-s00-01.png	thread .
e01-119-s01-00.png	Catch long end of thread ( Fig. 2 ) .
e01-119-s02-00.png	Draw loop through .
e01-119-s03-00.png	3 . Do not remove hook
e01-119-s03-01.png	from thread .
e01-119-s04-00.png	Pull short end and ball thread
e01-119-s04-01.png	in opposite directions to bring loop close around
e01-119-s04-02.png	the end of the hook , but not too tight
e01-119-s04-03.png	( Fig. 3 ) .
e01-119-s05-00.png	Loop thread round little finger ,
e01-119-s05-01.png	across palm and behind forefinger ( Fig. 4 ) .
e02-000-s00-00.png	A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
e02-000-s00-01.png	legs , and in reproduction period pieces they
e02-000-s00-02.png	are frequently used .
e02-000-s01-00.png	The simpler varieties are
e02-000-s01-01.png	extremely easy to work , the four sides being
e02-000-s01-02.png	simply planed to give the required taper .
e02-000-s02-00.png	In
e02-000-s02-01.png	the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is
e02-000-s02-02.png	worked in the solid , and this certainly
e02-000-s02-03.png	complicates the operation .
e02-014-s00-00.png	For short ones a smoothing plane can be used .
e02-014-s01-00.png	The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
e02-014-s01-01.png	on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated
e02-014-s01-02.png	as before .
e02-014-s02-00.png	It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
e02-014-s02-01.png	the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
e02-014-s02-02.png	of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
e02-014-s02-03.png	straight .
e02-018-s00-00.png	A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
e02-018-s00-01.png	end reveals when the required amount
e02-018-s00-02.png	has been removed , and if care is taken
e02-018-s00-03.png	to stop the plane short of the squared
e02-018-s00-04.png	pencil line at the top , the work will be
e02-018-s00-05.png	accurate .
e02-018-s01-00.png	The straight-edge can be used
e02-018-s01-01.png	to test the straightness of the sides .
e02-021-s00-00.png	Incidentally , it is better to
e02-021-s00-01.png	complete any mortising that may be
e02-021-s00-02.png	needed at the top before the tapering is
e02-021-s00-03.png	begun .
e02-021-s01-00.png	Some plain tapered legs have
e02-021-s01-01.png	the taper on the two inner faces only ,
e02-021-s01-02.png	the outer surfaces being vertical as
e02-021-s01-03.png	at ( B ) , Fig. 1 .
e02-021-s02-00.png	To make a leg such as
e02-021-s02-01.png	that at ( D ) , Fig. 1 , the square is first
e02-021-s02-02.png	marked out as at ( A ) , Fig. 3 .
e02-025-s00-00.png	Note that squared lines marking
e02-025-s00-01.png	the top member of the toe are
e02-025-s00-02.png	needed as well as the upper ex-
e02-025-s00-03.png	tent of the taper , and in
e02-025-s00-04.png	this case it is necessary to
e02-025-s00-05.png	mark in the line of the taper
e02-025-s00-06.png	with pencil and straight-edge
e02-025-s00-07.png	as at ( B ) , Fig. 3 .
e02-025-s01-00.png	A saw cut is
e02-025-s01-01.png	made at the upper toe line
e02-025-s01-02.png	exactly down to the taper line ,
e02-025-s01-03.png	no farther .
e02-074-s00-00.png	But why woodwork in particular ?
e02-074-s01-00.png	Well , there
e02-074-s01-01.png	are many reasons .
e02-074-s02-00.png	Wood is in good and
e02-074-s02-01.png	common supply ; it lends itself to making
e02-074-s02-02.png	innumerable useful household items -
e02-074-s02-03.png	furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ;
e02-074-s02-04.png	it enables results to be obtained fairly
e02-074-s02-05.png	quickly ; it is less expensive than most
e02-074-s02-06.png	other materials ; it is a pleasant material
e02-074-s02-07.png	to work with ; and , although it does
e02-074-s02-08.png	create a certain amount of mess , it is
e02-074-s02-09.png	all clean and easily cleared away .
e02-082-s00-00.png	This last point is certainly important because almost
e02-082-s00-01.png	everyone has come to recognise that machines
e02-082-s00-02.png	are not only an economic necessity , but that a
e02-082-s00-03.png	great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
e02-082-s00-04.png	installation of a power tool .
e02-082-s01-00.png	As an elementary
e02-082-s01-01.png	example , surely no one can pretend to enjoy
e02-082-s01-02.png	ripping out parts from hardwood .
e02-082-s02-00.png	Most men
e02-082-s02-01.png	would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
e02-082-s02-02.png	were available .
e02-086-s00-00.png	Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin
e02-086-s00-01.png	with what we have called a bare minimum kit .
e02-086-s01-00.png	Probably
e02-086-s01-01.png	most men have some of the tools already .
e02-086-s02-00.png	It will enable
e02-086-s02-01.png	a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in
e02-086-s02-02.png	any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
e02-086-s02-03.png	which other tools can be added as the need arises .
e02-086-s03-00.png	The
e02-086-s03-01.png	nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
e02-086-s03-02.png	to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit
e02-086-s03-03.png	which increases the range of things that can be
e02-086-s03-04.png	made enormously .
e02-091-s00-00.png	As a still further development , we follow
e02-091-s00-01.png	with a good basic kit , which includes
e02-091-s00-02.png	the fuller kit ( which in its turn , of course ,
e02-091-s00-03.png	includes the bare minimum kit ) .
e02-091-s01-00.png	With this the vast majority of jobs
e02-091-s01-01.png	can be done , though for advanced
e02-091-s01-02.png	cabinet work the necessity for
e02-091-s01-03.png	certain special tools will become
e02-091-s01-04.png	obvious .
e02-094-s00-00.png	Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and
e02-094-s00-01.png	machines , the choice of which will
e02-094-s00-02.png	depend partly upon the space available
e02-094-s00-03.png	in the workshop , the amount one
e02-094-s00-04.png	is prepared to pay , and the type of
e02-094-s00-05.png	work a man normally does .
e02-094-s01-00.png	First ,
e02-094-s01-01.png	however , a word of advice generally .
e02-094-s02-00.png	Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
e02-094-s02-01.png	machines .
e02-094-s03-00.png	They never are cheap in the
e02-094-s03-01.png	long run .
e02-094-s04-00.png	They may be inaccurate ,
e02-100-s00-00.png	Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults
e02-100-s00-01.png	in design or quality soon become apparent .
e02-100-s01-00.png	It is far
e02-100-s01-01.png	better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
e02-100-s01-02.png	quality , and not handicap yourself from the start .
e02-100-s02-00.png	To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow
e02-100-s02-01.png	yourself to blame the tools when the job does
e02-100-s02-02.png	not turn out quite right !
e02-117-s00-00.png	Many men with only limited accommodation
e02-117-s00-01.png	have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table .
e02-117-s01-00.png	Providing this is sound , some perfectly good
e02-117-s01-01.png	work can be done on it , but the usual problems
e02-117-s01-02.png	are those of the vice , the bench stop , and storage
e02-117-s01-03.png	place for tools .
e02-117-s02-00.png	The combined bench top and
e02-117-s02-01.png	tool cupboard shown here has been specially
e02-117-s02-02.png	designed and made for WOODWORKER
e02-117-s02-03.png	readers who have this difficulty .
e04-000-s00-00.png	HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
e04-000-s00-01.png	family man or father-to-be .
e04-000-s01-00.png	Unlike many
e04-000-s01-01.png	commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and
e04-000-s01-02.png	capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
e04-000-s01-03.png	most destructive youngster .
e04-000-s02-00.png	Almost any available
e04-000-s02-01.png	timber can be used but Parana pine is
e04-000-s02-02.png	recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and
e04-000-s02-03.png	taking a good finish .
e04-004-s00-00.png	Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
e04-004-s00-01.png	timber as shown in Fig. 1 .
e04-004-s01-00.png	Although the timber will have already
e04-004-s01-01.png	been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with
e04-004-s01-02.png	a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters
e04-004-s01-03.png	will show up after painting .
e04-004-s02-00.png	The dimensions given enable the
e04-004-s02-01.png	feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height
e04-004-s02-02.png	can be altered if required .
e04-008-s00-00.png	All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned ,
e04-008-s00-01.png	which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
e04-008-s00-02.png	appearance .
e04-008-s01-00.png	The side frames are joined by four cross pieces
e04-008-s01-01.png	each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses ( C ) ,
e04-008-s01-02.png	cut to fit them .
e04-011-s00-00.png	See Fig. 2 .
e04-011-s01-00.png	These are then glued and
e04-011-s01-01.png	pinned into place .
e04-011-s02-00.png	A similar piece of 1 in.
e04-011-s02-01.png	by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across
e04-011-s02-02.png	the end of the feeding tray as seen in
e04-011-s02-03.png	Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
e04-011-s02-04.png	hardboard is covered with plastic material
e04-011-s02-05.png	for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath
e04-011-s02-06.png	the frame with panel pins to complete
e04-011-s02-07.png	the feeding tray .
e04-015-s00-00.png	Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
e04-015-s00-01.png	fits up against the front legs of the
e04-015-s00-02.png	chair .
e04-015-s01-00.png	The seat rests across the upper two
e04-015-s01-01.png	cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
e04-015-s01-02.png	glued and panel pinned in position , measurements
e04-015-s01-03.png	being taken directly from the work .
e04-015-s02-00.png	Fig. 4
e04-015-s02-01.png	shows the framework for the back which
e04-015-s02-02.png	is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber .
e04-019-s00-00.png	The amount of the backward tilt and
e04-019-s00-01.png	also the height is left to personal choice
e04-019-s00-02.png	and the width is best taken directly
e04-019-s00-03.png	from the work to ensure a good fit .
e04-019-s01-00.png	Fix the piece A to the sides first
e04-019-s01-01.png	with glue and panel pins and then fit
e04-019-s01-02.png	the frame together with the piece
e04-019-s01-03.png	B temporarily in place on the chair
e04-019-s01-04.png	frame .
e04-022-s00-00.png	Decide on the required angle of slope ,
e04-022-s00-01.png	keeping B flat on the chair seat , and mark
e04-022-s00-02.png	off the exact position of B on the side
e04-022-s00-03.png	pieces .
e04-022-s01-00.png	These can then be cut at the correct
e04-022-s01-01.png	angle and B is glued and nailed in place .
e04-022-s02-00.png	A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned
e04-022-s02-01.png	to the frame and its edges planed off
e04-022-s02-02.png	flush .
e04-026-s00-00.png	Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
e04-026-s00-01.png	screws driven from the inside .
e04-026-s01-00.png	The footrest is a
e04-026-s01-01.png	piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.
e04-026-s01-02.png	by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair
e04-026-s01-03.png	of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5 .
e04-026-s02-00.png	When determining
e04-026-s02-01.png	the position of the footrest , do not place too near
e04-026-s02-02.png	the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs .
e04-030-s00-00.png	To complete the job , screw two fittings to the
e04-030-s00-01.png	inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
e04-030-s00-02.png	back to hold the baby's safety harness .
e04-030-s01-00.png	These can be
e04-030-s01-01.png	made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
e04-030-s01-02.png	wire as shown in Fig. 6 .
e04-030-s02-00.png	Make sure that these
e04-030-s02-01.png	are well secured as they will have to withstand
e04-030-s02-02.png	considerable pulling as the child becomes older .
e04-034-s00-00.png	Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes
e04-034-s00-01.png	with plastic wood .
e04-034-s01-00.png	Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
e04-034-s01-01.png	framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the
e04-034-s01-02.png	edge of the seat , feeding tray , etc ) .
e04-034-s02-00.png	Fill the grain with a
e04-034-s02-01.png	woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
e04-034-s02-02.png	a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour
e04-034-s02-03.png	for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
e04-034-s02-04.png	a suitable nursery transfer .
e04-038-s00-00.png	Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
e04-038-s00-01.png	if junior decides to bite the chair .
e04-038-s01-00.png	Finally , it is as well
e04-038-s01-01.png	to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
e04-038-s01-02.png	material that might be available as otherwise the
e04-038-s01-03.png	paint would soon be scratched off .
e04-038-s02-00.png	( J.H.P. )
e04-038-s03-00.png	BUILDING your own boat is a most
e04-038-s03-01.png	satisfying and worthwhile project .
e04-043-s00-00.png	Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
e04-043-s00-01.png	rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
e04-043-s00-02.png	sold .
e04-043-s01-00.png	It is especially designed for simplicity in
e04-043-s01-01.png	construction , cheapness and lightness of weight ,
e04-043-s01-02.png	and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft.
e04-043-s02-00.png	She
e04-043-s02-01.png	weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
e04-043-s02-02.png	and an outboard motor with a comfortable
e04-043-s02-03.png	margin of freeboard .
e04-052-s00-00.png	For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails
e04-052-s00-01.png	in place of screws .
e04-052-s01-00.png	We just bend them over and clamp
e04-052-s01-01.png	firmly by using a hammer on each side .
e04-052-s02-00.png	Over here I 've
e04-052-s02-01.png	always used brass screws , which are more expensive .
e04-052-s03-00.png	The first
e04-052-s03-01.png	job is to make your moulds .
e04-052-s04-00.png	In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply ,
e04-052-s04-01.png	but to save money any scrap may be used , and if this
e04-052-s04-02.png	is nailed and glued together strongly , it may be marked
e04-052-s04-03.png	and cut to shape later .
e04-058-s00-00.png	If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
e04-058-s00-01.png	the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in
e04-058-s00-02.png	Fig. 2 .
e04-058-s01-00.png	The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
e04-058-s01-01.png	rigid as possible , for it is on these you will be building
e04-058-s01-02.png	and shaping your little craft , upside-down .
e04-058-s02-00.png	For cheapness
e04-058-s02-01.png	I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
e04-058-s02-02.png	Columbia .
e04-062-s00-00.png	This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
e04-062-s00-01.png	a permanently water proof glue line .
e04-062-s01-00.png	Be sure to
e04-062-s01-01.png	see that the edge bears the mark , P.M.B.C. Exterior .
e04-062-s02-00.png	This may be bought at any good timber merchants .
e04-062-s03-00.png	The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
e04-062-s03-01.png	wood of the same make , or oak or mahogany .
e04-062-s04-00.png	For the
e04-062-s04-01.png	last one I made , I used the two flaps from an old
e04-062-s04-02.png	mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
e04-062-s04-03.png	shilling .
e04-068-s00-00.png	I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
e04-068-s00-01.png	rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3 ) .
e04-068-s01-00.png	They are very simple , cheap
e04-068-s01-01.png	and easy to make .
e04-068-s02-00.png	As will be seen from the plan
e04-068-s02-01.png	there is only a single gunwale on the outside .
e04-068-s03-00.png	I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
e04-068-s03-01.png	is difficult to obtain here and expensive .
e04-068-s04-00.png	I overcome
e04-068-s04-01.png	this in another way as shown in Fig. 4 .
e04-079-s00-00.png	Cut the moulds and the
e04-079-s00-01.png	transoms to shape as in the
e04-079-s00-02.png	detailed drawings .
e04-079-s01-00.png	If you have
e04-079-s01-01.png	a wooden floor you can use
e04-079-s01-02.png	' A ' frames fastened to the floor
e04-079-s01-03.png	if not , use a strong horizontal
e04-079-s01-04.png	frame that will sit firmly on
e04-079-s01-05.png	the ground or concrete floor .
e04-079-s02-00.png	I
e04-079-s02-01.png	use a heavy old base as in
e04-079-s02-02.png	Fig. 2 .
e04-083-s00-00.png	The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
e04-083-s00-01.png	correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat .
e04-083-s01-00.png	Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
e04-083-s01-01.png	to allow for the chines to rest in these
e04-083-s01-02.png	notches , as they are not fastened to the
e04-083-s01-03.png	moulds , which will only be used whilst
e04-083-s01-04.png	the hull is under construction .
e04-086-s00-00.png	The chine is the long stringer on each side which
e04-086-s00-01.png	is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves
e04-086-s00-02.png	cut in the moulds .
e04-086-s01-00.png	Each chine is made of oak ,
e04-086-s01-01.png	ash , spruce or any long grained flexible wood .
e04-086-s02-00.png	I
e04-086-s02-01.png	prefer spruce when available .
e04-086-s03-00.png	As will be seen
e04-086-s03-01.png	in the plan , the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in.
e04-086-s03-02.png	on each side .
e04-091-s00-00.png	The chines are morticed into this and butt up
e04-091-s00-01.png	against the transom .
e04-091-s01-00.png	Start at the bow and
e04-091-s01-01.png	spring them both at the same time over the
e04-091-s01-02.png	slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
e04-091-s01-03.png	cut for this purpose in the stern or after
e04-091-s01-04.png	transom framing .
e04-091-s02-00.png	Glue , screw and make fast .
e04-095-s00-00.png	The skeleton of the boat will now take shape ,
e04-095-s00-01.png	and this is the time to check before making fast
e04-095-s00-02.png	to see that nothing is distorted .
e04-095-s01-00.png	Ensure that
e04-095-s01-01.png	the outside measurements from transom to transom
e04-095-s01-02.png	are equal on each side and that the transoms
e04-095-s01-03.png	are parallel horizontally .
e04-095-s02-00.png	Next bevel the chines
e04-095-s02-01.png	with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly .
e04-099-s00-00.png	Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
e04-099-s00-01.png	plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
e04-099-s00-02.png	planing after fixing to the boat .
e04-099-s01-00.png	Use your two
e04-099-s01-01.png	lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
e04-099-s01-02.png	purpose , the sides from one , and the bottom from
e04-099-s01-03.png	the other .
e04-099-s02-00.png	If care is taken not to waste the
e04-099-s02-01.png	ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts .
e04-103-s00-00.png	Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready
e04-103-s00-01.png	to plank the sides .
e04-103-s01-00.png	Start again at the bows ,
e04-103-s01-01.png	clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp .
e04-103-s02-00.png	Bend
e04-103-s02-01.png	round the frame to the stern and clamp there .
e04-103-s03-00.png	If
e04-103-s03-01.png	you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
e04-103-s03-02.png	well .
e04-103-s04-00.png	After generously covering with glue , screw
e04-103-s04-01.png	the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
e04-109-s00-00.png	Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail
e04-109-s00-01.png	with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if
e04-109-s00-02.png	you are doing it that way .
e04-109-s01-00.png	Use flat head screws
e04-109-s01-01.png	about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
e04-109-s01-02.png	the 1/4 in. ply .
e04-109-s02-00.png	Make a very small hole for
e04-109-s02-01.png	the screw to allow for a good grip .
e04-109-s03-00.png	Remember
e04-109-s03-01.png	to glue before screwing .
e04-114-s00-00.png	Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom ,
e04-114-s00-01.png	which is cut in one piece .
e04-114-s01-00.png	It should overlap just a
e04-114-s01-01.png	trifle ; this can be cleaned up later .
e04-114-s02-00.png	As you are
e04-114-s02-01.png	screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
e04-114-s02-02.png	necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
e04-114-s02-03.png	the screws .
e04-114-s03-00.png	I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
e04-114-s03-01.png	the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and
e04-114-s03-02.png	the bottom shaped transom facing .
e04-119-s00-00.png	Again , don't forget to glue .
e04-119-s01-00.png	Now put on the keel and
e04-119-s01-01.png	the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
e04-119-s01-02.png	the moulds .
e04-119-s02-00.png	You won't want them again for this boat , so
e04-119-s02-01.png	shift them right out of the way .
e04-119-s03-00.png	Place the boat right side
e04-119-s03-01.png	up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for
e04-119-s03-02.png	working .
e04-124-s00-00.png	Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts ( seats )
e04-124-s00-01.png	taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
e04-124-s00-02.png	with vertical members as shown in the plans .
e04-124-s01-00.png	Make the
e04-124-s01-01.png	four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
e04-124-s01-02.png	before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
e04-124-s01-03.png	a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside ( gunwale )
e04-124-s01-04.png	one to fit the block .
e04-127-s00-00.png	I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
e04-127-s00-01.png	with copper nails and roves .
e04-127-s01-00.png	It greatly improves the
e04-127-s01-01.png	appearance and the strength .
e04-127-s02-00.png	Paint with good marine primer ,
e04-127-s02-01.png	undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint .
e04-127-s03-00.png	WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
e04-127-s03-01.png	into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
e04-127-s03-02.png	making fabric pictures or designs .
e04-132-s00-00.png	While these may ultimately be made into a picture
e04-132-s00-01.png	for framing and hanging on a wall , they may
e04-132-s00-02.png	also be arranged into a design , and the
e04-132-s00-03.png	resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful
e04-132-s00-04.png	article .
e06-000-s00-00.png	This could hardly happen without the
e06-000-s00-01.png	herring having some orientation with the
e06-000-s00-02.png	sea bottom .
e06-000-s01-00.png	It means that the crowding
e06-000-s01-01.png	is caused during the daytime , and that
e06-000-s01-02.png	the herring must continue to migrate over
e06-000-s01-03.png	the ground as well as in midwater and
e06-000-s01-04.png	during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
e06-000-s01-05.png	is always from the north ) .
e06-003-s00-00.png	Thus we can see that herring
e06-003-s00-01.png	movements , although primarily
e06-003-s00-02.png	instinctive perhaps , and certainly
e06-003-s00-03.png	helped and hindered by water flow ,
e06-003-s00-04.png	are also closely related to the sea-bed
e06-003-s00-05.png	geography .
e06-003-s01-00.png	Geography , too , names the
e06-003-s01-01.png	great fisheries that depend on them :
e06-003-s01-02.png	the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
e06-003-s01-03.png	shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut ,
e06-003-s01-04.png	a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
e06-003-s01-05.png	the herring spawn along the northern
e06-006-s00-00.png	The effect of bottom congestion due to
e06-006-s00-01.png	the light pressure is inevitably mixed
e06-006-s00-02.png	with that of the suitability of ground
e06-006-s00-03.png	for spawning .
e06-006-s01-00.png	Both result in crowding ,
e06-006-s01-01.png	so there is no need to try to separate
e06-006-s01-02.png	them - thank Heaven !
e06-006-s02-00.png	A good picture of
e06-006-s02-01.png	this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
e06-006-s02-02.png	grounds from the Viking in the north down
e06-006-s02-03.png	to the Klondykes and the Reef along
e06-006-s02-04.png	the western edge of the Norwegian
e06-006-s02-05.png	Deep .
e06-010-s00-00.png	In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
e06-010-s01-00.png	Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure .
e06-010-s02-00.png	But
e06-010-s02-01.png	they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until
e06-010-s02-02.png	in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
e06-010-s02-03.png	echo-sounders .
e06-010-s03-00.png	Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
e06-010-s03-01.png	their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
e06-010-s03-02.png	gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
e06-010-s03-03.png	spawning herring are always found .
e06-015-s00-00.png	The joint evidence of echo-sounders
e06-015-s00-01.png	and fishing gear leads to an overall
e06-015-s00-02.png	though somewhat dim picture .
e06-015-s01-00.png	The details are harder still to see .
e06-015-s02-00.png	Drift Effects .
e06-015-s03-00.png	At East Anglia , for instance ,
e06-015-s03-01.png	shoals that gather at the Knoll or
e06-015-s03-02.png	other banks are most of them
e06-015-s03-03.png	going to travel a hundred
e06-015-s03-04.png	miles farther south before they
e06-015-s03-05.png	spawn .
e06-015-s04-00.png	Some will spawn at the
e06-021-s00-00.png	So the arrival of any particular shoal
e06-021-s00-01.png	fish at a certain spawning ground may
e06-021-s00-02.png	be accidental .
e06-021-s01-00.png	Yet there will always be some
e06-021-s01-01.png	that find it if enough are travelling , just as
e06-021-s01-02.png	the robin who gets back exactly may be
e06-021-s01-03.png	only one among thousands who do not .
e06-021-s02-00.png	But this southerly migration is not
e06-021-s02-01.png	accidental .
e06-021-s03-00.png	Being contranatant or against
e06-021-s03-01.png	the drift , it probably has a survival value
e06-021-s03-02.png	in ensuring that the fry after hatching
e06-021-s03-03.png	are drifted back into the normal home
e06-026-s00-00.png	Drift in another form probably
e06-026-s00-01.png	explains how these migrating herring
e06-026-s00-02.png	are biased to east or west by the
e06-026-s00-03.png	different winds .
e06-026-s01-00.png	Strong westerlies
e06-026-s01-01.png	are well known to bring good
e06-026-s01-02.png	longshore fishings .
e06-026-s02-00.png	The surface
e06-026-s02-01.png	water that is blown offshore must
e06-026-s02-02.png	be replaced by an underflow bringing
e06-026-s02-03.png	with it the herring to the Norfolk
e06-026-s02-04.png	and Suffolk beaches .
e06-030-s00-00.png	Easterly winds , on the other hand ,
e06-030-s00-01.png	mean no herring along the shore , as
e06-030-s00-02.png	recent years have shown .
e06-030-s01-00.png	A succession
e06-030-s01-01.png	of winds is needed for this effect of
e06-030-s01-02.png	course - one breeze will not do it ,
e06-030-s01-03.png	though a very hard westerly will
e06-030-s01-04.png	often start off the local herring ;
e06-030-s01-05.png	but quite apart from this wind effect
e06-030-s01-06.png	there is an easterly drift special
e06-030-s01-07.png	to this rump of coastline , caused by
e06-030-s01-08.png	the meeting of water from north and south .
e06-033-s00-00.png	Herring fishermen call this the outset .
e06-033-s01-00.png	It
e06-033-s01-01.png	is strongest at spring tides , when without
e06-033-s01-02.png	wind you will set out - or drift to the east-
e06-033-s01-03.png	ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -
e06-033-s01-04.png	almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
e06-033-s01-05.png	Knoll .
e06-033-s02-00.png	Without an explanation of how it
e06-033-s02-01.png	works , it may well be that this outset , akin
e06-033-s02-02.png	to the mouth of a great salmon river , has
e06-033-s02-03.png	been the biggest factor through the ages
e06-033-s02-04.png	in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
e06-037-s00-00.png	The East Anglian behaviour ( see p. 82 )
e06-037-s00-01.png	has always differed from that of the
e06-037-s00-02.png	summer fisheries .
e06-037-s01-00.png	There is the swim 
e06-037-s01-01.png	at slack waters , even in daylight
e06-037-s01-02.png	sometimes ; and the high swimming ,
e06-037-s01-03.png	when fish are caught only in the top
e06-037-s01-04.png	few yards of netting .
e06-037-s02-00.png	These and other
e06-037-s02-01.png	fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
e06-037-s02-02.png	to this fishery , which unfortunately seems
e06-037-s02-03.png	to be dying out ; but a full discussion of
e06-037-s02-04.png	them is beyond the present scope .
e06-041-s00-00.png	The Bow-wave Theory .
e06-041-s01-00.png	This assumes
e06-041-s01-01.png	that all fishing gear , when moving ,
e06-041-s01-02.png	sends before it a kind of scaring effect ,
e06-041-s01-03.png	probably through waves or vibrations in
e06-041-s01-04.png	the water or along the ground .
e06-041-s02-00.png	Underwater films suggest that the
e06-041-s02-01.png	footrope of a trawl does this .
e06-041-s03-00.png	Films
e06-041-s03-01.png	have also shown plaice moving before
e06-041-s03-02.png	a seine net in just the same way after
e06-041-s03-03.png	being gathered inwards by the ropes .
e06-046-s00-00.png	( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may
e06-046-s00-01.png	be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed
e06-046-s00-02.png	sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations
e06-046-s00-03.png	through or along the bottom . )
e06-046-s01-00.png	But given such a bow
e06-046-s01-01.png	wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something
e06-046-s01-02.png	to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught .
e06-049-s00-00.png	Let us consider first what would
e06-049-s00-01.png	appear to be the simplest case -
e06-049-s00-02.png	that of flat fish on the bottom .
e06-049-s01-00.png	The evidence suggest that the fish are
e06-049-s01-01.png	aware of the moving footrope before
e06-049-s01-02.png	it reaches them .
e06-049-s02-00.png	They move away before
e06-049-s02-01.png	it , swimming at the same speed
e06-049-s02-02.png	for an unknown period of time , until
e06-049-s02-03.png	they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used
e06-049-s02-04.png	to the disturbance .
e06-053-s00-00.png	Then they stop swimming and are caught .
e06-053-s01-00.png	In
e06-053-s01-01.png	the seine-net film this usually seemed to
e06-053-s01-02.png	happen just after the fish had risen above
e06-053-s01-03.png	the footrope , and presumably out of its
e06-053-s01-04.png	field of disturbance , or bow wave .
e06-053-s02-00.png	This suggests
e06-053-s02-01.png	that the wave might be transmitted by the
e06-053-s02-02.png	sea-bed , though the footrope in this case
e06-053-s02-03.png	was actually just off the bottom and was
e06-053-s02-04.png	indeed passing over some fish .
e06-070-s00-00.png	Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
e06-070-s01-00.png	And in this film the rise of the fish was
e06-070-s01-01.png	small , a matter of a foot or two .
e06-070-s02-00.png	With round
e06-070-s02-01.png	fish like haddock , which would hardly
e06-070-s02-02.png	find safety on the bottom , this cover
e06-070-s02-03.png	would seem to be even more essential ;
e06-070-s02-04.png	but more films are needed to prove this .
e06-070-s03-00.png	Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
e06-070-s03-01.png	essential to catch round fish whose
e06-070-s03-02.png	reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
e07-000-s00-00.png	WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain
e07-000-s00-01.png	when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons
e07-000-s00-02.png	of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when
e07-000-s00-03.png	20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin .
e07-000-s01-00.png	An eye-
e07-000-s01-01.png	witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with
e07-000-s01-02.png	the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti-
e07-000-s01-03.png	cide poisoning .
e07-003-s00-00.png	Wholesale chemical spraying , upsetting as it
e07-003-s00-01.png	does the balance of nature by killing both pests
e07-003-s00-02.png	and predators , is viewed with concern by a
e07-003-s00-03.png	number of American State Research Stations .
e07-003-s01-00.png	Not
e07-003-s01-01.png	content with issuing bulletins on the dangers
e07-003-s01-02.png	of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture ,
e07-003-s01-03.png	some stations are carrying out useful research on
e07-003-s01-04.png	pest control by biological means .
e07-003-s02-00.png	Both native and
e07-003-s02-01.png	imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
e07-003-s02-02.png	are used in field trial tests .
e07-007-s00-00.png	The biological control of pests in the garden
e07-007-s00-01.png	is not new to the American gardener .

e07-007-s02-01.png	religiosa ) , both native and immigrant varieties ,
e07-007-s02-02.png	are used by gardeners in all parts of the United
e07-007-s02-03.png	States .
e07-007-s03-00.png	Advertisements offer eggs of European ,
e07-007-s03-01.png	Chinese or native forms of mantis .
e07-012-s00-00.png	From the day it hatches in the spring
e07-012-s00-01.png	until it dies in the late autumn , the
e07-012-s00-02.png	praying mantis satisfies its voracity by
e07-012-s00-03.png	eating other insects .
e07-012-s01-00.png	Nine blowflies
e07-012-s01-01.png	may be consumed at one sitting and
e07-012-s01-02.png	the fully adult , 2 1/2-in.-long insect ,
e07-012-s01-03.png	is able to keep a firm hold on one
e07-012-s01-04.png	grasshopper while eating another .
e07-012-s02-00.png	According to Dr. Max Beier in Fang-
e07-012-s02-01.png	heuschrecken ( Die Neue Brehm Bu ckerei ,
e07-012-s02-02.png	1952 ) , the praying mantis is trecking
e07-012-s02-03.png	northwards .
e07-061-s00-00.png	Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an
e07-061-s00-01.png	egg-case of the Chinese mantis .
e07-061-s01-00.png	The
e07-061-s01-01.png	first mantis had hatched from the very large
e07-061-s01-02.png	egg-case on June 6 .
e07-061-s02-00.png	Both the Chinese
e07-061-s02-01.png	and Spanish mantis , in the young stage
e07-061-s02-02.png	at any rate , are light brown in colour .
e07-061-s03-00.png	Because of the cool , wet weather , I had great
e07-061-s03-01.png	difficulty in breeding fruit flies and , after
e07-061-s03-02.png	many of the mantis of both types had died
e07-061-s03-03.png	in my Kilner jars , I poured living mantis
e07-061-s03-04.png	over vines and peachtrees .
e07-066-s00-00.png	A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in
e07-066-s00-01.png	Grantham , Lincs , kindly offered to
e07-066-s00-02.png	cooperate with me in studying praying
e07-066-s00-03.png	mantis as a pest control in the cold
e07-066-s00-04.png	greenhouse .
e07-066-s01-00.png	Of the dozen Spanish mantis
e07-066-s01-01.png	sent him by post on June 22 , only two or
e07-066-s01-02.png	three survived the journey ; one thrived
e07-066-s01-03.png	and the latest report I have is that
e07-066-s01-04.png	this mantis is still alive .
e07-072-s00-00.png	DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
e07-072-s00-01.png	since the end of the war , clay pots are
e07-072-s00-02.png	still in greatest demand .
e07-072-s01-00.png	It is mostly
e07-072-s01-01.png	in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
e07-072-s01-02.png	have made headway , and although
e07-072-s01-03.png	numerous small clay pots are used each
e07-072-s01-04.png	year , they are fewer than they were 10
e07-072-s01-05.png	years ago .
e07-072-s02-00.png	In the larger sizes there is still
e07-072-s02-01.png	no real substitute for clay that can be
e07-072-s02-02.png	obtained at a comparable price , except the
e07-072-s02-03.png	bituminized paper pots which are used on
e07-072-s02-04.png	commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
e07-076-s00-00.png	The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
e07-076-s00-01.png	brittle nature ; even with reasonably careful
e07-076-s00-02.png	handling , the annual losses are often around
e07-076-s00-03.png	10 per cent. , and where the handling and
e07-076-s00-04.png	storage facilities are not too good , these
e07-076-s00-05.png	losses will be even greater .
e07-076-s01-00.png	This does not
e07-076-s01-01.png	necessarily apply to the larger sizes , as
e07-076-s01-02.png	they are not quite so fragile as the
e07-076-s01-03.png	smaller ones and are not normally thrown
e07-076-s01-04.png	about in quite the same way .
e07-079-s00-00.png	The storage problem puts clay pots at a
e07-079-s00-01.png	definite disadvantage .
e07-079-s01-00.png	They are fairly heavy
e07-079-s01-01.png	and difficult things to accommodate and
e07-079-s01-02.png	they must have some protection from severe
e07-079-s01-03.png	weather , which can be quite a headache in
e07-079-s01-04.png	a small garden .
e07-079-s02-00.png	While admitting that
e07-079-s02-01.png	broken pots have on occasions provided
e07-079-s02-02.png	artists with delightful studies , there is no
e07-079-s02-03.png	doubt that a pile of badly stacked ,
e07-079-s02-04.png	half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
e07-079-s02-05.png	from any point of view .
e07-083-s00-00.png	Every garden boy will agree that having to
e07-083-s00-01.png	wash clay pots is a definite factor in
e07-083-s00-02.png	favour of their abolition ; in fact one
e07-083-s00-03.png	young man was so wholehearted about this
e07-083-s00-04.png	a few years ago that he made the headlines
e07-083-s00-05.png	for having smashed a large number # to
e07-083-s00-06.png	relieve his feelings .
e07-083-s01-00.png	On the small-to-medium
e07-083-s01-01.png	establishment , it is a disagreeable chore
e07-083-s01-02.png	which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm ,
e07-083-s01-03.png	whereas on larger establishments the pots
e07-083-s01-04.png	can be sterilized or washed by machine .
e07-086-s00-00.png	It is not easy to make an economic
e07-086-s00-01.png	comparison between clay pots and the various
e07-086-s00-02.png	substitutes ; the former may last indefinitely
e07-086-s00-03.png	with luck , while the latter are often
e07-086-s00-04.png	expendable used only once .
e07-086-s01-00.png	Clay pots are
e07-086-s01-01.png	efficient and congenial containers in which
e07-086-s01-02.png	to grow plants .
e07-086-s02-00.png	In their proper setting they
e07-086-s02-01.png	are not unattractive and , in spite of
e07-086-s02-02.png	their shortcomings , most gardeners have
e07-086-s02-03.png	a nostalgic affection for them .
e07-090-s00-00.png	Present-day pots are better finished , do
e07-090-s00-01.png	not get dirty so readily and are easier to
e07-090-s00-02.png	wash .
e07-090-s01-00.png	The deep rims make for neater and
e07-090-s01-01.png	safer stacking , though they are still
e07-090-s01-02.png	expensive and still get broken .
e07-090-s02-00.png	On the
e07-090-s02-01.png	other hand , there is really no replacement
e07-090-s02-02.png	for the larger sizes , so they have the
e07-090-s02-03.png	decided advantage of being the only
e07-090-s02-04.png	suitable container available in quantity
e07-090-s02-05.png	for fairly large plants .
e07-094-s00-00.png	Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
e07-094-s00-01.png	pots for plant raising .
e07-094-s01-00.png	These are compressed blocks of
e07-094-s01-01.png	compost , made in a specially devised press to
e07-094-s01-02.png	simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot .
e07-094-s02-00.png	Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape , they
e07-094-s02-01.png	are made of the same compost as would have
e07-094-s02-02.png	been used in a pot , the # only difference being
e07-094-s02-03.png	that it is used in a slightly moister
e07-094-s02-04.png	condition .
e07-098-s00-00.png	Seed is sown , or seedlings are pricked out into them
e07-098-s00-01.png	in the normal way , the only real difference
e07-098-s00-02.png	being that more of the watering is done through a
e07-098-s00-03.png	rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
e07-098-s00-04.png	of water .
e07-098-s01-00.png	First-class plants of tomatoes ,
e07-098-s01-01.png	cucumbers , marrows , melons , cauliflowers ,
e07-098-s01-02.png	celery and onions , may all be raised in soil
e07-098-s01-03.png	blocks ; so can such flowering plants as
e07-098-s01-04.png	dahlias , chrysanthemums , salvias , sweet peas ,
e07-098-s01-05.png	lupins and numerous others .
e07-101-s00-00.png	One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
e07-101-s00-01.png	one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved
e07-101-s00-02.png	completely .
e07-101-s01-00.png	Manufacturing the block and planting
e07-101-s01-01.png	it is very little more trouble than normal potting ,
e07-101-s01-02.png	and a superior plant , which transplants more
e07-101-s01-03.png	easily , is produced .
e07-101-s02-00.png	The obvious limitation #
e07-101-s02-01.png	is that soil blocks can only be used for
e07-101-s02-02.png	propagating ; there can be no progression to a
e07-101-s02-03.png	larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
e07-101-s02-04.png	to be moved ; it must be planted out or
e07-101-s02-05.png	potted .
e07-105-s00-00.png	Many amateur gardeners might improve their
e07-105-s00-01.png	results by buying a small hand-operated soil
e07-105-s00-02.png	block maker and use the money saved on
e07-105-s00-03.png	buying small pots to improve their composts .
e07-105-s01-00.png	The various types of small paper pots are very
e07-105-s01-01.png	useful for short-term operations , but are
e07-105-s01-02.png	inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
e07-105-s01-03.png	too long .
e07-108-s00-00.png	They are # quite useful for plants that are
e07-108-s00-01.png	despatched to market or direct to customers ,
e07-108-s00-02.png	their cheapness making them attractive to the
e07-108-s00-03.png	nurseryman ; there is also considerable saving
e07-108-s00-04.png	in carriage costs because of their lightness .
e07-108-s01-00.png	There are many types of plastic pots available ;
e07-108-s01-01.png	some expensive , some quite cheap ; some good
e07-108-s01-02.png	and others not so good .
e07-108-s02-00.png	A wide range of
e07-108-s02-01.png	plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
e07-108-s02-02.png	usually need less water than those in clay
e07-108-s02-03.png	pots .
e07-112-s00-00.png	They are slightly more difficult to
e07-112-s00-01.png	manage , however , until a little experience
e07-112-s00-02.png	has been gained with them .
e07-112-s01-00.png	Plastic pots
e07-112-s01-01.png	are usually more expensive than clay ones ,
e07-112-s01-02.png	but they are almost indestructible and
e07-112-s01-03.png	will last a long time with normal care .
f01-053-s00-00.png	The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
f01-053-s00-01.png	vocabulary to work on the existing store
f01-053-s00-02.png	so as to make it grow .
f01-053-s01-00.png	He does not
f01-053-s01-01.png	simply pack new things into the store .
f01-053-s02-00.png	The solitary learner has to find out
f01-053-s02-01.png	how to do this for himself , with the help
f01-053-s02-02.png	of books .
f01-053-s03-00.png	He uses his vocabulary to
f01-053-s03-01.png	ask questions and uses the books to
f01-053-s03-02.png	find the answers .
f01-058-s00-00.png	Thus learning how to learn means becoming
f01-058-s00-01.png	your own philosopher , your own psychologist
f01-058-s00-02.png	and your own teacher .
f01-058-s01-00.png	You will then be
f01-058-s01-01.png	a well-established learner and the world
f01-058-s01-02.png	will be at your feet .
f01-058-s02-00.png	Although the word
f01-058-s02-01.png	 mind has given rise to endless
f01-058-s02-02.png	controversy among philosophers and psycho-
f01-058-s02-03.png	logists , many of whom would like to
f01-058-s02-04.png	abolish it from the dictionary , most
f01-058-s02-05.png	of us obstinately go on using it .
f01-066-s00-00.png	And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
f01-066-s00-01.png	 mind vanishes , at any rate for some time .
f01-066-s01-00.png	It seems very difficult
f01-066-s01-01.png	to detach the mind from the brain , and all the biological ,
f01-066-s01-02.png	surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
f01-066-s01-03.png	close connection .
f01-066-s02-00.png	There is a lot to be said for keeping the
f01-066-s02-01.png	word soul to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable
f01-066-s02-02.png	essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
f01-066-s02-03.png	the body , and to reserve the more prosaic word mind for
f01-066-s02-04.png	the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
f01-066-s02-05.png	are clearly associated with the brain .
f01-070-s00-00.png	Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
f01-070-s00-01.png	picture of this basis of mental phenomena ?
f01-070-s01-00.png	The physicists have succeeded remarkably well ,
f01-070-s01-01.png	with the atomic theory , in giving a clear and detailed
f01-070-s01-02.png	picture of the basis of such material phenomena
f01-070-s01-03.png	as chemical action , magnetism , the behaviour of
f01-070-s01-04.png	gases and so on .
f01-070-s02-00.png	Where has psychology got to in its
f01-070-s02-01.png	theories of mind ?
f01-070-s03-00.png	Are there any ultimate units
f01-070-s03-01.png	of mind akin to the atoms of matter ?
f01-075-s00-00.png	At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
f01-075-s00-01.png	be analysed into discrete bits .
f01-075-s01-00.png	These bits were
f01-075-s01-01.png	identified as elementary sensations .
f01-075-s02-00.png	These were
f01-075-s02-01.png	thought to combine together to form compound
f01-075-s02-02.png	experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
f01-075-s02-03.png	matter combine to form molecular compounds .
f01-075-s03-00.png	But this view led to too many difficulties and
f01-075-s03-01.png	was finally abandoned .
f01-075-s04-00.png	Nevertheless the search
f01-075-s04-01.png	for basic units of mind has gone on and will
f01-075-s04-02.png	doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to
f01-075-s04-03.png	discover ultimate units .
f01-081-s00-00.png	We must beware , however , of supposing that there must be any
f01-081-s00-01.png	close analogy between the units of quite different
f01-081-s00-02.png	sciences .
f01-081-s01-00.png	For example the success of the atomic theory
f01-081-s01-01.png	in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
f01-081-s01-02.png	units of geometry must be points .
f01-081-s02-00.png	It would be more
f01-081-s02-01.png	correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
f01-081-s02-02.png	geometry .
f01-085-s00-00.png	There have been many conflicting tendencies in
f01-085-s00-01.png	psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
f01-085-s00-02.png	we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
f01-085-s00-03.png	concept which is current today .
f01-085-s01-00.png	It is known as the schema .
f01-085-s02-00.png	It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
f01-085-s02-01.png	concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
f01-085-s02-02.png	but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction .
f01-135-s00-00.png	It is the tendency to get things
f01-135-s00-01.png	the wrong way round .
f01-135-s01-00.png	As a
f01-135-s01-01.png	psychologist I am constantly
f01-135-s01-02.png	encountering this tendency
f01-135-s01-03.png	in friends and acquaintances .
f01-135-s02-00.png	They think there is something
f01-135-s02-01.png	inevitably queer about psychology
f01-135-s02-02.png	and this feeling of queerness
f01-135-s02-03.png	usually boils down to a quite
f01-135-s02-04.png	mistaken belief that the
f01-135-s02-05.png	psychologist first looks into ...
f01-139-s00-00.png	This is what I mean by getting things the wrong way
f01-139-s00-01.png	round .
f01-139-s01-00.png	He is far more likely to find out about how
f01-139-s01-01.png	his own mind works by looking at other people's .
f01-139-s02-00.png	For although looking inwards ( or introspecting 
f01-139-s02-01.png	as it is called ) , is not entirely ruled out ,
f01-139-s02-02.png	nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
f01-139-s02-03.png	one of the most unreliable methods of getting
f01-139-s02-04.png	any precise information .
f01-143-s00-00.png	And so they prefer objective methods .
f01-143-s01-00.png	Since they cannot
f01-143-s01-01.png	directly look into the mental processes of another
f01-143-s01-02.png	person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
f01-143-s01-03.png	to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
f01-143-s01-04.png	this behaviour .
f01-143-s02-00.png	This is no more queer than the method
f01-143-s02-01.png	of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms ,
f01-143-s02-02.png	and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them .
f01-147-s00-00.png	He may never have had the disease himself but he
f01-147-s00-01.png	can nevertheless identify it .
f01-147-s01-00.png	Similarly the psychologist has
f01-147-s01-01.png	to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
f01-147-s01-02.png	all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they
f01-147-s01-03.png	correspond with anything in his own experience .
f01-147-s02-00.png	We know
f01-147-s02-01.png	very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
f01-147-s02-02.png	provide our schemas , nor do we need to know as far as
f01-147-s02-03.png	psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
f01-147-s02-04.png	the neuro-physiologists .
f02-000-s00-00.png	The numerically largest group , consisting of male
f02-000-s00-01.png	weekly wage-earners up to chargehand level
f02-000-s00-02.png	and in the works only , excluding the offices , was
f02-000-s00-03.png	therefore selected .
f02-000-s01-00.png	A detailed age-structure was
f02-000-s01-01.png	compiled from personnel department records ,
f02-000-s01-02.png	revealing that there were ( at that time ) seven-
f02-000-s01-03.png	teen men seventy years of age or older ,
f02-000-s01-04.png	thirty-three aged sixty-four years , and sixty-
f02-000-s01-05.png	five just fifty years of age .
f02-003-s00-00.png	A small panel was formed , not on a formally representative
f02-003-s00-01.png	basis but rather of energetic and concerned individuals ,
f02-003-s00-02.png	from various levels in the firm .
f02-003-s01-00.png	In due course
f02-003-s01-01.png	the panel decided to seek further insight into the
f02-003-s01-02.png	problems faced by older workers , and approached
f02-003-s01-03.png	those seventy years of age or older .
f02-017-s00-00.png	The Rubery , Owen scheme is now in its
f02-017-s00-01.png	fourth year , and opportunity has been taken
f02-017-s00-02.png	to revise the course in the light of
f02-017-s00-03.png	experience .
f02-017-s01-00.png	Topics for the six weekly meetings
f02-017-s01-01.png	of one-and-a-half hours ( each held half in
f02-017-s01-02.png	company time , half in the man's time ) are
f02-017-s01-03.png	now as follows : 1 . Personal adjustment 2 . Health
f02-017-s01-04.png	3 . Work and leisure 4 . Living arrangements
f02-017-s01-05.png	5 . Financial planning 6 . Final discussion
f02-020-s00-00.png	The weekend conference for the men and their wives ,
f02-020-s00-01.png	which takes place at company expense in a country or
f02-020-s00-02.png	resort hotel , includes an address on ' The Woman's Point
f02-020-s00-03.png	of View ' and one on ' Making the Most of Health ' .
f02-020-s01-00.png	Separate
f02-020-s01-01.png	discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
f02-020-s01-02.png	plenary sessions .
f02-020-s02-00.png	Of the men reaching fifty years of age
f02-020-s02-01.png	since the scheme started , 125 ( 37.2 per cent ) have
f02-020-s02-02.png	taken part .
f02-030-s00-00.png	The original scheme was planned to provide short re-
f02-030-s00-01.png	fresher courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty :
f02-030-s00-02.png	the first of these is due in 1963 .
f02-030-s01-00.png	Meanwhile , each
f02-030-s01-01.png	' graduate ' is encouraged to seek help and advice in
f02-030-s01-02.png	working out his ideas , either through the company's
f02-030-s01-03.png	personnel department or by an approach to
f02-030-s01-04.png	members of the panel responsible for the scheme .
f02-033-s00-00.png	The latter do not regard themselves as expert
f02-033-s00-01.png	advisers , but are prepared to seek out the
f02-033-s00-02.png	appropriate sources of information or advice .
f02-033-s01-00.png	Towards the end of 1956 , Mr. Daniel Grant ,
f02-033-s01-01.png	an Employee Relations Officer of
f02-033-s01-02.png	Rolls-Royce Ltd. and a member of the
f02-033-s01-03.png	Workers' Educational Association , submitted
f02-033-s01-04.png	to the Lord Provost of Glasgow , Dr. Andrew
f02-033-s01-05.png	Hood , a copy of his report on an enquiry
f02-033-s01-06.png	he had made into the problems that beset
f02-033-s01-07.png	older workers and the effects of retirement
f02-033-s02-00.png	Hugentobler Roger
f02-036-s00-00.png	The Lord Provost , having studied the report on ' The Morale and
f02-036-s00-01.png	Health of Retired Workers ' , and being satisfied that the matters
f02-036-s00-02.png	raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
f02-036-s00-03.png	Glasgow and warranted further study , set an informal
f02-036-s00-04.png	committee representative of bodies particularly concerned with
f02-036-s00-05.png	the welfare of older people to examine the report and
f02-036-s00-06.png	its implications and to consider the advisability of
f02-036-s00-07.png	arranging a Conference on Preparation for and
f02-036-s00-08.png	Occupational Activities on Retirement .
f02-038-s00-00.png	The large attendance and atmosphere of
f02-038-s00-01.png	this Conference , held in October , 1957 ,
f02-038-s00-02.png	reflected not only an increasing awareness
f02-038-s00-03.png	of the problems of men and women nearing
f02-038-s00-04.png	or already in retirement but also a strong
f02-038-s00-05.png	desire on the part of all concerned for
f02-038-s00-06.png	concerted action towards preparing men
f02-038-s00-07.png	and women for life in retirement and more
f02-038-s00-08.png	adequate provision of facilities for
f02-038-s00-09.png	crafts , hobbies and leisure-time interests
f02-038-s00-10.png	for those who are retired .
f02-040-s00-00.png	As a result , the Glasgow Retirement Council came
f02-040-s00-01.png	into being in April , 1958 , with Dr. Andrew Hood as
f02-040-s00-02.png	chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary .
f02-040-s01-00.png	The
f02-040-s01-01.png	Council has active committees on Education and
f02-040-s01-02.png	Preparation for Retirement , and on Occupational
f02-040-s01-03.png	Centres .
f02-040-s02-00.png	The former consists of representatives from
f02-040-s02-01.png	the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department ;
f02-040-s02-02.png	the Workers' Educational Association ; the University
f02-040-s02-03.png	Extra-Mural Education Committee and departments
f02-040-s02-04.png	of psychology , education and social science ; ... .
f02-044-s00-00.png	In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks , Assistant Director
f02-044-s00-01.png	of Education for Glasgow , that industrial firms might be ready
f02-044-s00-02.png	to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
f02-044-s00-03.png	for retirement , their wages paid for the time thus spent .
f02-044-s01-00.png	An
f02-044-s01-01.png	approach was made to about twenty large firms and in Oc-
f02-044-s01-02.png	tober , 1959 , the first experimental day-release course for
f02-044-s01-03.png	men was organised .
f02-044-s02-00.png	Eleven students from seven firms atten-
f02-044-s02-01.png	ded a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both
f02-044-s02-02.png	to the men and their employers that the venture was an
f02-044-s02-03.png	experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
f02-044-s02-04.png	as the participants .
f02-076-s00-00.png	1 . Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
f02-076-s00-01.png	and retirement according to the occupational
f02-076-s00-02.png	level of employees ?
f02-076-s01-00.png	2 . If so , which occupational
f02-076-s01-01.png	levels are the better or the poorer prepared
f02-076-s01-02.png	for successful adjustment to retirement and
f02-076-s01-03.png	in what aspects ?
f02-076-s02-00.png	3 . Does the evidence
f02-076-s02-01.png	obtained support a rationale for adapting
f02-076-s02-02.png	a pre-retirement planning and preparation
f02-076-s02-03.png	programme to the needs of older employees
f02-076-s02-04.png	of different occupational levels ?
f03-169-s00-00.png	Each time you rehearse you will probably put
f03-169-s00-01.png	things in a different way .
f03-169-s01-00.png	All the better ! - it will
f03-169-s01-01.png	sound much more spontaneous on the occasion
f03-169-s01-02.png	itself .
f03-169-s02-00.png	Remember your four names - have the list
f03-169-s02-01.png	with you if you like - and you simply can't
f03-169-s02-02.png	be flummoxed !
f03-169-s03-00.png	Of course , in any speech a good
f03-169-s03-01.png	start and a good finish are half the battle .
f03-174-s00-00.png	So - see the next page !
f03-174-s01-00.png	Yes , they are waiting for you .
f03-174-s02-00.png	But there is no need to be frightened .
f03-174-s03-00.png	The audience
f03-174-s03-01.png	will eat out of your hand - if they like what
f03-174-s03-02.png	you offer them .
f03-174-s04-00.png	A good start will put them in a
f03-174-s04-01.png	good humour .
f03-174-s05-00.png	Ladies and gentlemen !
f03-174-s06-00.png	I 'm afraid
f03-174-s06-01.png	I have not had much experience of public speaking .
f03-182-s00-00.png	But that 's a terrible way to begin !
f03-182-s01-00.png	Why tell them you
f03-182-s01-01.png	are a novice ?
f03-182-s02-00.png	It 's their interest you want - not their
f03-182-s02-01.png	sympathy .
f03-182-s03-00.png	And you want to get it from the word
f03-182-s03-01.png	GO !
f03-182-s04-00.png	Try something like this :
f03-182-s05-00.png	It is said that tele-
f03-182-s05-01.png	vision keeps people at home .
f03-182-s06-00.png	But you , at any
f03-182-s06-01.png	rate , have proved that wrong .
f03-182-s07-00.png	And they say , too ,
f03-182-s07-01.png	that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
f03-182-s07-02.png	intelligence .
f03-191-s00-00.png	May I suggest that you have proved that
f03-191-s00-01.png	right !
f03-191-s01-00.png	Congratulations !
f03-191-s02-00.png	And away you go into
f03-191-s02-01.png	your speech .
f03-191-s03-00.png	Take some thought , too , for your ending .
f03-191-s04-00.png	Thank you for listening to me so patiently .
f03-191-s05-00.png	A political
f03-191-s05-01.png	candidate often used that finish .
f03-191-s06-00.png	No wonder he
f03-191-s06-01.png	didn't get in !
f03-191-s07-00.png	Instead he might have ended
f03-191-s07-01.png	this way :
f03-191-s08-00.png	Well , those are my views .
f04-004-s00-00.png	When he learned what was causing the commotion he
f04-004-s00-01.png	became greatly alarmed , and after the body had been
f04-004-s00-02.png	taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
f04-004-s00-03.png	grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
f04-004-s00-04.png	Camp , aged thirty-three , the girl who was to have
f04-004-s00-05.png	been his bride .
f04-004-s01-00.png	There was little doubt of how
f04-004-s01-01.png	she had met her death , and even less that it
f04-004-s01-02.png	had been murder .
f04-007-s00-00.png	She had been struck several times with a blunt
f04-007-s00-01.png	instrument , and her head was smashed in .
f04-007-s01-00.png	There were signs of a violent struggle , blood
f04-007-s01-01.png	on the cushions and floor , and the remains
f04-007-s01-02.png	of her broken umbrella .
f04-007-s02-00.png	But a pair of bone
f04-007-s02-01.png	cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
f04-007-s02-02.png	to provide the only possible clue to the killer .
f04-011-s00-00.png	The body was examined , and it was definitely
f04-011-s00-01.png	established that no sexual assault had taken place .
f04-011-s01-00.png	It seemed probable that the motive had been
f04-011-s01-01.png	robbery , and this was further confirmed when a
f04-011-s01-02.png	check was made with the woman's relations in
f04-011-s01-03.png	Hounslow .
f04-011-s02-00.png	Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
f04-011-s02-01.png	Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth .
f04-011-s03-00.png	Her day
f04-011-s03-01.png	off was Thursday , and before coming up to London
f04-011-s03-02.png	in the evening she had called on her two sisters ,
f04-011-s03-03.png	one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
f04-011-s03-04.png	other at Hounslow , where she kept a shop .
f04-016-s00-00.png	Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon ,
f04-016-s00-01.png	and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M. , where
f04-016-s00-02.png	she had tea with her other sister , and then
f04-016-s00-03.png	went to catch the 7.42 .
f04-016-s01-00.png	Her sister saw her
f04-016-s01-01.png	to the station , helping her with some of
f04-016-s01-02.png	her packages .
f04-016-s02-00.png	This sister was able to establish
f04-016-s02-01.png	that she had carried a green purse and
f04-016-s02-02.png	had bought a railway ticket .
f04-020-s00-00.png	But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body
f04-020-s00-01.png	was found at Waterloo .
f04-020-s01-00.png	Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
f04-020-s01-01.png	likely that she had been carrying much money .
f04-020-s02-00.png	A porter at Hounslow
f04-020-s02-01.png	supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
f04-020-s02-02.png	compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it
f04-020-s02-03.png	had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo .
f04-024-s00-00.png	The police began a systematic search of the line -
f04-024-s00-01.png	no easy task , but one in which patience and method
f04-024-s00-02.png	paid off .
f04-024-s01-00.png	At a spot on the embankment between
f04-024-s01-01.png	Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
f04-024-s01-02.png	pestle such as chemists use , with some hairs
f04-024-s01-03.png	sticking to it .
f04-024-s02-00.png	The murder weapon , more than likely ,
f04-024-s02-01.png	and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
f04-024-s02-02.png	killer to book in modern times .
f04-028-s00-00.png	But in 1897 , alas ! there was no fingerprint bureau ,
f04-028-s00-01.png	no experts to check and photograph any ' dabs ' it
f04-028-s00-02.png	might have yielded .
f04-028-s01-00.png	It was a tough case to
f04-028-s01-01.png	tackle , and Superintendent Robinson , of the L.S.W.R.
f04-028-s01-02.png	Police , and Chief Inspector Marshall , of Scotland
f04-028-s01-03.png	Yard , combined forces in the investigation .
f04-028-s02-00.png	While
f04-028-s02-01.png	accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
f04-028-s02-02.png	attacked for the sake of robbery , they did not
f04-028-s02-03.png	overlook the possibility that this might have
f04-028-s02-04.png	disguised another motive , and a thorough check
f04-028-s02-05.png	of her former men friends and acquaintances began .
f04-032-s00-00.png	They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours , so-
f04-032-s00-01.png	me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a
f04-032-s00-02.png	man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
f04-032-s00-03.png	the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from
f04-032-s00-04.png	his hands .
f04-032-s01-00.png	The inquest was opened on February 17 , but ,
f04-032-s01-01.png	beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
f04-032-s01-02.png	the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
f04-032-s01-03.png	in which she had died , there was nothing on
f04-032-s01-04.png	which to proceed , and the inquest was
f04-032-s01-05.png	adjourned .
f04-035-s00-00.png	Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
f04-035-s00-01.png	trails .
f04-035-s01-00.png	It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
f04-035-s01-01.png	money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for
f04-035-s01-02.png	a detailed account of his movements on the 11th .
f04-035-s02-00.png	The dead
f04-035-s02-01.png	woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
f04-035-s02-02.png	named Brown .
f04-039-s00-00.png	This man agreed that his engagement had
f04-039-s00-01.png	been broken off after one particular
f04-039-s00-02.png	tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
f04-039-s00-03.png	money .
f04-039-s01-00.png	All the while the police were casting about
f04-039-s01-01.png	for a man who had been seen leaving the train
f04-039-s01-02.png	at Wandsworth .
f04-039-s02-00.png	A passenger described this individual
f04-039-s02-01.png	as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with
f04-039-s02-02.png	a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat
f04-039-s02-03.png	and a top-hat .
f04-043-s00-00.png	The porter at the station bore out this
f04-043-s00-01.png	description , but the man was not traced .
f04-043-s01-00.png	Perhaps the news of their search got around ,
f04-043-s01-01.png	for a man did obligingly present himself
f04-043-s01-02.png	at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have
f04-043-s01-03.png	committed the murder - but he was mentally
f04-043-s01-04.png	defective , and , despite his claim to infamy ,
f04-043-s01-05.png	had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .
f04-046-s00-00.png	Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body , which
f04-046-s00-01.png	had at first been considered as belonging to the killer ,
f04-046-s00-02.png	proved yet another red herring , for it was learned that
f04-046-s00-03.png	they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
f04-046-s00-04.png	of her sisters .
f04-046-s01-00.png	A young man from Reading named Marshall
f04-046-s01-01.png	had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner .
f04-049-s00-00.png	This man was known to have left his home on February 11 , and
f04-049-s00-01.png	to have been away for four days .
f04-049-s01-00.png	Not in itself a crime , but , added to
f04-049-s01-01.png	the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
f04-049-s01-02.png	dford for a false moustache , it left him with something to
f04-049-s01-03.png	explain .
f04-049-s02-00.png	His story was that he had left home to try to
f04-049-s02-01.png	join the Army ( presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
f04-049-s02-02.png	his military bearing ) , and this was accepted .
f04-053-s00-00.png	And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with
f04-053-s00-01.png	adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return
f04-053-s00-02.png	a verdict of wilful murder against some person or
f04-053-s00-03.png	persons unknown . 
f04-053-s01-00.png	The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
f04-053-s01-01.png	pestle had been of no assistance .
f04-053-s02-00.png	The killer must
f04-053-s02-01.png	have been very thankful that the science of
f04-053-s02-02.png	dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings .
f04-057-s00-00.png	The next female fatality occurred eight years later ,
f04-057-s00-01.png	yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
f04-057-s00-02.png	a further seven years before even a ghost of a
f04-057-s00-03.png	solution emerged .
f04-057-s01-00.png	There has always been something
f04-057-s01-01.png	sinister in the idea of tunnels .
f04-057-s02-00.png	The building of
f04-057-s02-01.png	them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
f04-057-s02-02.png	nected with railway construction ; and there
f04-057-s02-03.png	were many people who believed that to travel
f04-057-s02-04.png	through tunnels would be an equally
f04-057-s02-05.png	hazardous business .
f04-061-s00-00.png	Some thought that the result would be all
f04-061-s00-01.png	sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
f04-061-s00-02.png	confined atmosphere .
f04-061-s01-00.png	 The shareholders who travel
f04-061-s01-01.png	by it will be so heartily sick , what with the
f04-061-s01-02.png	foul air , smoke and sulphur , that the mention
f04-061-s01-03.png	of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha , 
f04-061-s01-04.png	wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
f04-061-s01-05.png	proposed to build the Box Tunnel .
f04-064-s00-00.png	The mere thought of subterranean travel
f04-064-s00-01.png	gave others a feeling of danger .
f04-064-s01-00.png	A medical journal
f04-064-s01-01.png	said , the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden
f04-064-s01-02.png	immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated
f04-064-s01-03.png	sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
f04-064-s01-04.png	momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill
f04-064-s01-05.png	of annihilation . 
f04-064-s02-00.png	It was also prophesied that
f04-064-s02-01.png	passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
f04-064-s02-02.png	darkness .
f04-068-s00-00.png	For all that , as far as England is concerned ,
f04-068-s00-01.png	there have been only two occasions on
f04-068-s00-02.png	which a body has been found in a tunnel
f04-068-s00-03.png	in circumstances pointing to murder .
f04-068-s01-00.png	The first was that of Mr Gold , in the famous
f04-068-s01-01.png	Lefroy case , and by an odd chance the second tragedy
f04-068-s01-02.png	occurred on the same line , although this time the
f04-068-s01-03.png	victim was a woman .
f04-071-s00-00.png	Though in the minds of most people there was
f04-071-s00-01.png	no doubt that the woman had been the victim
f04-071-s00-02.png	of foul play , the verdict brought in was that there
f04-071-s00-03.png	was not sufficient evidence to show whether
f04-071-s00-04.png	she had fallen or been thrown from a train .
f04-071-s01-00.png	The Merstham Tunnel , on the London-to-
f04-071-s01-01.png	Brighton line , is approximately one mile long ,
f04-071-s01-02.png	and some time before midnight on September
f04-071-s01-03.png	24 , 1905 , a Sunday , Sub-Inspector Peacock , of
f04-071-s01-04.png	the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway ,
f04-074-s00-00.png	It was the battered and broken body of a woman .
f04-074-s01-00.png	He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
f04-074-s01-01.png	Station , and a stretcher party took the body to
f04-074-s01-02.png	the Feathers Hotel to await identification .
f04-074-s02-00.png	Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul
f04-074-s02-01.png	had walked deliberately into the blackness and
f04-074-s02-02.png	into the path of some train ?
f04-074-s03-00.png	This hardly seemed
f04-074-s03-01.png	likely , since , when she was examined by a local
f04-074-s03-02.png	doctor , the woman , young , small , and rather plump ,
f04-074-s03-03.png	was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
f04-074-s03-04.png	almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends
f04-074-s03-05.png	thrust in her mouth like a gag .
f04-079-s00-00.png	Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising ,
f04-079-s00-01.png	and there were other injuries on her body which had
f04-079-s00-02.png	occurred before her death was ensured by some
f04-079-s00-03.png	train which had roared through the tunnel .
f04-079-s01-00.png	There were
f04-079-s01-01.png	no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
f04-079-s01-02.png	fication , no money , and no railway ticket .
f04-079-s02-00.png	By then
f04-079-s02-01.png	reports were being gathered about all traffic over
f04-079-s02-02.png	this stretch of line , but no information was
f04-079-s02-03.png	forthcoming about any carriage with an open
f04-079-s02-04.png	door , nor any passenger reporting an incident
f04-079-s02-05.png	which might relate .
f04-083-s00-00.png	So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
f04-083-s00-01.png	long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
f04-083-s00-02.png	remained a mystery until later the following day .
f04-083-s01-00.png	During that time a description of the girl was
f04-083-s01-01.png	circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
f04-083-s01-02.png	identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two .
f04-083-s02-00.png	The girl , who was described as being always bright and
f04-083-s02-01.png	jolly , had been unmarried , and lived at Lavender Hill ,
f04-083-s02-02.png	Clapham , on the premises of a dairyman , Bridger , for
f04-083-s02-03.png	whom she worked as a book-keeper .
f04-087-s00-00.png	On the Sunday , the day of her death , she had gone out in the
f04-087-s00-01.png	evening at about seven o'clock , telling her room-mate , Emma
f04-087-s00-02.png	Hone , that she was going for a walk , but would not be
f04-087-s00-03.png	gone for long .
f04-087-s01-00.png	According to Miss Hone , she had not been
f04-087-s01-01.png	carrying a handbag , but she believed she had had a small
f04-087-s01-02.png	purse .
f04-093-s00-00.png	At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector
f04-093-s00-01.png	was able to identify a photograph of the
f04-093-s00-02.png	girl , and he said he had last seen her
f04-093-s00-03.png	on platform six waiting to board
f04-093-s00-04.png	a train for the short run to Victoria .
f04-093-s01-00.png	A passenger at Victoria said he had seen
f04-093-s01-01.png	a young lady as near as possible 
f04-093-s01-02.png	like the photograph shown him , with
f04-093-s01-03.png	a man very close in conversation and
f04-093-s01-04.png	walking arm in arm . 
f04-096-s00-00.png	A guard reported that at East Croydon
f04-096-s00-01.png	he had seen what was accepted as the
f04-096-s00-02.png	same couple sitting close together in
f04-096-s00-03.png	a first-class compartment of the
f04-096-s00-04.png	train from London Bridge of which
f04-096-s00-05.png	he was in charge .
f04-096-s01-00.png	The two could
f04-096-s01-01.png	have joined this train by taking
f04-096-s01-02.png	one from Victoria and changing
f04-096-s01-03.png	at East Croydon .
f04-096-s02-00.png	He also believed
f04-096-s02-01.png	that they had still been together at
f04-096-s02-02.png	South Croydon , and he remembered
f04-100-s00-00.png	Medical evidence established that Mary
f04-100-s00-01.png	Money had been dead for about an
f04-100-s00-02.png	hour before her body was discovered ,
f04-100-s00-03.png	and this matched reasonably well with
f04-100-s00-04.png	the timetable of the train in question .
f04-100-s01-00.png	More important evidence came from a
f04-100-s01-01.png	signalman at Purley Oaks , who had
f04-100-s01-02.png	seen , as the train passed his box , a
f04-100-s01-03.png	couple struggling in a first-class
f04-100-s01-04.png	compartment ; but he seemed to have
f04-100-s01-05.png	been used to seeing couples engaged in
f07-000-s00-00.png	SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000-s00-01.png	told us that there was nothing an En-
f07-000-s00-02.png	glishman would not do ; nothing an Ame-
f07-000-s00-03.png	rican would not say ; nothing an
f07-000-s00-04.png	Italian would not sing ; no music
f07-000-s00-05.png	to which the Frenchman would not
f07-000-s00-06.png	dance ; nothing the German would
f07-000-s00-07.png	not covet ; and nothing the Chinese
f07-000-s00-08.png	would not eat .
f07-000b-s00-00.png	SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000b-s00-01.png	told us that there was nothing an Englishman
f07-000b-s00-02.png	would not do ; nothing an American would not
f07-000b-s00-03.png	say ; nothing an Italian would not sing ; no
f07-000b-s00-04.png	music to which the Frenchman would not dance ;
f07-000b-s00-05.png	nothing the German would not covet ; and
f07-000b-s00-06.png	nothing the Chinese would not eat .
f07-002-s00-00.png	It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum .
f07-002-s01-00.png	Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
f07-002-s01-01.png	the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
f07-002-s01-02.png	borrowed straight from the prehistoric .
f07-002-s02-00.png	How
f07-002-s02-01.png	many centuries ago , in some cave or hilly
f07-002-s02-02.png	hide , did our forebears home from the chase
f07-002-s02-03.png	hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
f07-002-s02-04.png	meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
f07-002-s02-05.png	homely and protecting flame .
f07-006-s00-00.png	How many centuries later did the mercenary in
f07-006-s00-01.png	the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
f07-006-s00-02.png	evening meal .
f07-006-s01-00.png	Later came the thrifty peasant ,
f07-006-s01-01.png	later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
f07-006-s01-02.png	in Paris , and even later our attractive young
f07-006-s01-03.png	ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
f07-006-s01-04.png	gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants .
f07-009-s00-00.png	And , if certain dishes and modes of food have
f07-009-s00-01.png	persisted down the ages , the motive that preserved
f07-009-s00-02.png	them has always been the same .
f07-009-s01-00.png	Apart from the need
f07-009-s01-01.png	for nourishment , the instinct of hospitality has
f07-009-s01-02.png	always been strong in mankind .
f07-009-s02-00.png	The sharing of
f07-009-s02-01.png	a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
f07-009-s02-02.png	admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
f07-009-s02-03.png	important than the casual meetings of the present
f07-009-s02-04.png	day ; the desire to share something more intimate
f07-009-s02-05.png	than mere converse has always been there .
f07-013-s00-00.png	The truth is that good food offers a
f07-013-s00-01.png	programme of entertainment almost
f07-013-s00-02.png	unlimited in its variety and its presen-
f07-013-s00-03.png	tation affords an opportunity of
f07-013-s00-04.png	showing a guest something of ourselves .
f07-013-s01-00.png	It is a far enough cry from the primitive
f07-013-s01-01.png	meal-times of a simpler world to the
f07-013-s01-02.png	banquets of later days , when the table
f07-013-s01-03.png	groaned under its load of complicated
f07-013-s01-04.png	dishes , and for all the blossoming of the
f07-013-s01-05.png	arts around them the diners were little
f07-016-s00-00.png	There was always the spice of an orgy
f07-016-s00-01.png	in those Roman feasts , for instance , with
f07-016-s00-02.png	all their peacocks and nightingales'
f07-016-s00-03.png	tongues ; unreasonable surfeit , too , in the
f07-016-s00-04.png	elaborate fashion of eating brought
f07-016-s00-05.png	out of Italy into France , we are told ,
f07-016-s00-06.png	by Catherine de Medici .
f07-016-s01-00.png	The peasant in
f07-016-s01-01.png	those days , as ever , ate sparingly , but
f07-016-s01-02.png	generously enough in his own fashion ,
f07-016-s01-03.png	save at feast times , when he , too , let
f07-016-s01-04.png	himself go ; and it was from his simpler
f07-019a-s00-00.png	Epicures and gourmands , sated by the unending
f07-019a-s00-01.png	procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
f07-019a-s00-02.png	of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
f07-019a-s00-03.png	grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
f07-019a-s00-04.png	the dishes of the country , and , instead of gorging the
f07-019a-s00-05.png	eye with magnitude , began to understand the value of
f07-019a-s00-06.png	intelligent selection and comparative simplicity , though
f07-019a-s00-07.png	nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
f07-019a-s00-08.png	monstrous .

f07-021a-s00-00.png	Does one , however , know who first thought of boiling
f07-021a-s00-01.png	water and food ?
f07-021a-s01-00.png	The ancient Britons , I believe , used to
f07-021a-s01-01.png	make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it ,
f07-021a-s01-02.png	because their pots would not stand fire ; but Jacob
f07-021a-s01-03.png	must have had one that would , because Esau sold
f07-021a-s01-04.png	his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and
f07-021a-s01-05.png	then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after
f07-021a-s01-06.png	which the Israelites sighed .

f07-024a-s02-00.png	When the languid flames at
f07-024a-s02-01.png	length subside , He throws a bed of glowing
f07-024a-s02-02.png	embers wide ; Above the coals the smoking
f07-024a-s02-03.png	fragment turns , And sprinkles sacred salt from

f07-028a-s01-00.png	A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets

f07-028a-s01-03.png	of one sense alone .

f07-032a-s00-01.png	perfumes , these refined voluptuaries aroused the

f07-032a-s01-00.png	The gratification of the sense of smelling
f07-032a-s01-01.png	was a subject of no little importance to the Romans .
f07-032a-s02-00.png	They considered flowers as forming a very essential
f07-032a-s02-01.png	article in their festal preparations ; and it is the
f07-032a-s02-02.png	opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
f07-032a-s02-03.png	number of flowers far exceeded the number
f07-032a-s02-04.png	of fruits .
f07-032b-s00-00.png	By delicate application of odours and richly-
f07-032b-s00-01.png	distilled perfumes , these refined voluptuaries
f07-032b-s00-02.png	aroused the fainting appetite and added a

f07-036-s00-01.png	a mingled shower of flowers and odorous

f07-036-s00-03.png	recreations of Heliogabalus was to
f07-036-s00-04.png	smother his courtiers with flowers .
f07-036-s01-00.png	Nor was
f07-036-s01-01.png	it entirely as an object of luxury that the
f07-036-s01-02.png	ancients made use of flowers ; they were
f07-036-s01-03.png	considered to possess sanative and
f07-036-s01-04.png	medicinal qualities .
f07-039a-s00-00.png	According to Pliny , and others , certain herbs

f07-069-s01-00.png	We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes
f07-069-s01-01.png	one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under
f07-069-s01-02.png	which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years .
f07-069-s02-00.png	If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red
f07-069-s02-01.png	with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation ,
f07-069-s02-02.png	Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which
f07-069-s02-03.png	provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant
f07-073-s00-00.png	The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener
f07-073-s00-01.png	Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with

f07-073-s00-04.png	crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a pastry cook to
f07-073-s00-05.png	celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683 .
f07-073-s01-00.png	Spanish
f07-073-s01-01.png	cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights , of Spanish dancing
f07-073-s01-02.png	and of Goja : it is vivid , highly coloured , sometimes
f07-073-s01-03.png	Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour , with
f07-073-s01-04.png	streaks of poetry , meat disguised under heavy and vehement
f07-076a-s00-00.png	The Czechoslovak kitchen , again , is
f07-076a-s00-01.png	so languorous , so passionate , and
f07-076a-s00-02.png	possibly comparable alone to a gypsy
f07-076a-s00-03.png	melody .

f07-081a-s00-01.png	of good food and the gusto which they

g01-000-s00-00.png	A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was
g01-000-s00-01.png	imprisoned in England .
g01-000-s01-00.png	His son , in revenge , was
g01-000-s01-01.png	harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg ,
g01-000-s01-02.png	and doing it to some purpose .
g01-000-s02-00.png	John Philpot ,
g01-000-s02-01.png	one of that new class of merchant financiers
g01-000-s02-02.png	which the city of London was now producing , fitted ,
g01-000-s02-03.png	equipped and manned a fleet from his own
g01-000-s02-04.png	resources , and captured the young Mercer in a
g01-000-s02-05.png	brilliant Channel fight .
g01-004-s00-00.png	It was naturally a highly popular victory with the
g01-004-s00-01.png	Londoners , but it brought heavy censure from nobles
g01-004-s00-02.png	who still believed that they had a monopoly of
g01-004-s00-03.png	leadership .
g01-004-s01-00.png	But , at last , Gaunt sailed .
g01-004-s02-00.png	Opposing
g01-004-s02-01.png	him was the French Admiral , Jean de Vienne -
g01-004-s02-02.png	a great sailor and an able strategist .
g01-008-s00-00.png	Obedient to the policy of his King , de Vienne avoided
g01-008-s00-01.png	trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it
g01-008-s00-02.png	on land .
g01-008-s01-00.png	Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for
g01-008-s01-01.png	an elusive foe , and , afraid to return home without
g01-008-s01-02.png	something to show , he foolishly attempted to besiege
g01-008-s01-03.png	the well-protected fortress of St Malo .
g01-008-s02-00.png	This
g01-008-s02-01.png	involved the dreary method of mining operations in
g01-008-s02-02.png	which Gaunt , under the Black Prince , had shown
g01-008-s02-03.png	considerable skill at the siege of Limoges .
g01-012-s00-00.png	When all seemed to be going well , a sortie surprised
g01-012-s00-01.png	moment had charge of the mine ; the mine collapsed
g01-012-s00-02.png	fame and glory .
g01-012-s01-00.png	Gaunt was compelled to return
g01-012-s01-01.png	even despised failure .
g01-012-s02-00.png	The ' ribald ' Londoners , who

g01-016-s00-00.png	These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
g01-016-s00-01.png	obvious morals for those who are judges long
g01-016-s00-02.png	after the event .
g01-016-s01-00.png	It seems obvious that , though
g01-016-s01-01.png	the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
g01-016-s01-02.png	plate and mail of French knights , a brilliant
g01-016-s01-03.png	battle was no substitute for a sound policy ,
g01-016-s01-04.png	and that , if archers had no target , campaigns
g01-016-s01-05.png	became mere marauding route marches .
g01-019-s00-00.png	It seems obvious that if an expedition to
g01-019-s00-01.png	Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais ,
g01-019-s00-02.png	then the primary essential to the success
g01-019-s00-03.png	of the French war was a navy in unquestioned
g01-019-s00-04.png	command of the Channel .
g01-019-s01-00.png	It seems obvious
g01-019-s01-01.png	that divided forces were dissipating the
g01-019-s01-02.png	advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included

g01-019-s01-04.png	and that there was no hope of final victory
g01-019-s01-05.png	without a large-scale and concentrated invasion .
g01-022-s00-00.png	BUT NONE OF THESE DEDUCTIONS WERE
g01-022-s00-01.png	DRAWN AT THE TIME , BECAUSE LARGE-
g01-022-s00-02.png	SCALE WAR REQUIRED MONEY , AND
g01-022-s00-03.png	THE CITIZENS WHO HAD THE MONEY
g01-022-s00-04.png	WERE NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY AT

g01-022-s00-07.png	ANCING A RULING CLASS WHICH
g01-022-s00-08.png	DESPISED THEM .
g01-022-s01-00.png	THE COMMONS WERE
g01-022-s01-01.png	GLAD ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE FRUITS
g01-025-s00-00.png	In this cruel process which was
g01-025-s00-01.png	hammering out nations on the anvils of
g01-025-s00-02.png	war , there was a constant stirring of
g01-025-s00-03.png	those in authority to find some simple
g01-025-s00-04.png	way out of the complicated financial
g01-025-s00-05.png	6impasse which always resulted , and in the
g01-025-s00-06.png	story of the experiments and expedients
g01-025-s00-07.png	to which the Exchequer resorted is
g01-025-s00-08.png	the story of the prelude to the
g01-025-s00-09.png	Peasants' Revolt of 1381 .
g01-027-s00-00.png	In appreciating this story , modern con-
g01-027-s00-01.png	ceptions of governmental duties must be
g01-027-s00-02.png	set aside .
g01-027-s01-00.png	A modern government needs
g01-027-s01-01.png	taxation not merely for defence and
g01-027-s01-02.png	offence but for a very wide range of
g01-027-s01-03.png	social services .
g01-027-s02-00.png	A mediaeval oligarchy
g01-027-s02-01.png	needed taxation in order to supplement
g01-027-s02-02.png	the private wealth of the monarchy
g01-027-s02-03.png	( the royal income from the revenues of
g01-027-s02-04.png	crown lands , the fees of feudalism
g01-031-s00-00.png	Social service as a function of government
g01-031-s00-01.png	was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
g01-031-s00-02.png	substitute was the mutual self-help of
g01-031-s00-03.png	communities , whether those communities were
g01-031-s00-04.png	monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and
g01-031-s00-05.png	guilds of a city .
g01-031-s01-00.png	A mediaeval tax was
g01-031-s01-01.png	therefore in essence a forced payment whose
g01-031-s01-02.png	return was the uncertain bounty of booty
g01-031-s01-03.png	and the vague advantages of military glory ;
g01-031-s01-04.png	it was therefore always granted grudgingly
g01-031-s01-05.png	and coupled with the vain hope that , in the
g01-034-s00-00.png	When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
g01-034-s00-01.png	booty , a new group of Lords might oust
g01-034-s00-02.png	the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,
g01-034-s00-03.png	who usually supplied the hard cash , might
g01-034-s00-04.png	be bold enough to demand the production of
g01-034-s00-05.png	accounts , and even at times the impeachment of
g01-034-s00-06.png	the unsuccessful .
g01-034-s01-00.png	But the Commons were not
g01-034-s01-01.png	the people , and even a full Parliament was
g01-034-s01-02.png	not yet a true mirror of the nation .
g01-037-s00-00.png	The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
g01-037-s00-01.png	' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
g01-037-s00-02.png	feudal obligations of work or villeins who
g01-037-s00-03.png	had bought their release , free labourers
g01-037-s00-04.png	who worked for the highest bidders , free
g01-037-s00-05.png	yeomen who had prospered enough to become
g01-037-s00-06.png	successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,
g01-037-s00-07.png	journeymen and small tradesmen of the
g01-037-s00-08.png	towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms
g01-037-s00-09.png	in the pay of landed Lords .
g01-039-s00-00.png	None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or
g01-039-s00-01.png	expected to pay direct taxes .
g01-039-s01-00.png	During the four-
g01-039-s01-01.png	teenth century , the traditional methods of
g01-039-s01-02.png	financing the Exchequer had become stabilized .
g01-039-s02-00.png	When the King and his Council required additio-
g01-039-s02-01.png	nal funds , they were usually granted an
g01-039-s02-02.png	export tax on the wool trade , collected by
g01-039-s02-03.png	means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that
g01-039-s02-04.png	prices , quality and tax could be efficiently su-
g01-039-s02-05.png	pervised and controlled , together with a
g01-043-s00-00.png	There were two other sources of public revenue -
g01-043-s00-01.png	first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead
g01-043-s00-02.png	of the Commons and in its own Convocations
g01-043-s00-03.png	granted equivalent contributions , and second ,
g01-043-s00-04.png	the foreign merchants , with whom the King's
g01-043-s00-05.png	officials had formerly made private bargains
g01-043-s00-06.png	at ' colloquies of merchants ' , and whose
g01-043-s00-07.png	payments were now authorized by parliamentary
g01-043-s00-08.png	sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
g01-043-s00-09.png	excess of the rate for native merchants .
g01-045-s00-00.png	In addition to these revenues , the King had the
g01-045-s00-01.png	financial benefits of his position at the head
g01-045-s00-02.png	of the feudal system , as its chief landowner
g01-045-s00-03.png	and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
g01-045-s01-00.png	It was , therefore , a complicated and not very
g01-045-s01-01.png	satisfactory financial system in which the
g01-045-s01-02.png	borders between private and public purse were
g01-045-s01-03.png	as ill-defined as the borders between private
g01-045-s01-04.png	and national war , and in which the comparati-
g01-045-s01-05.png	vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
g01-067-s00-00.png	But this time there was a very interesting
g01-067-s00-01.png	attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
g01-067-s00-02.png	payments demanded .
g01-067-s01-00.png	The definition of an
g01-067-s01-01.png	adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,
g01-067-s01-02.png	and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,
g01-067-s01-03.png	the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
g01-067-s01-04.png	of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,
g01-067-s01-05.png	and between these two extremes a graduated
g01-067-s01-06.png	scale of payments was fixed for the
g01-067-s01-07.png	different classes of laymen and clerics .
g01-070-s00-00.png	Again the resentment was widespread and
g01-070-s00-01.png	the results disappointing - a tax estimated
g01-070-s00-02.png	to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 .
g01-070-s01-00.png	In the following year , 1380 , the last and
g01-070-s01-01.png	most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
g01-070-s01-02.png	by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
g01-070-s02-00.png	There were dark reasons for a meeting so
g01-070-s02-01.png	far away from the capital in a town with
g01-070-s02-02.png	poor communications and not over supplied
g01-070-s02-03.png	with hostelries and lodgings .
g01-074-s00-00.png	London was again in turmoil ; but this time
g01-074-s00-01.png	over a question of trade rivalry .
g01-074-s01-00.png	A rich mer-
g01-074-s01-01.png	chant from Genoa had been murdered , and
g01-074-s01-02.png	John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of
g01-074-s01-03.png	those charged with the crime .
g01-074-s02-00.png	It is clear
g01-074-s02-01.png	from the chronicles that this was a sordid
g01-074-s02-02.png	quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
g01-074-s03-00.png	The city merchants were jealous of foreign
g01-074-s03-01.png	merchants who could tempt court and
g01-074-s03-02.png	baronage with rarer luxuries than those
g01-083-s00-00.png	A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure
g01-083-s00-01.png	to mediaeval eyes .
g01-083-s01-00.png	It was determined that 100,000
g01-083-s01-01.png	was a fairer target , and the Parliament agreed to find
g01-083-s01-02.png	two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
g01-083-s01-03.png	the remainder .
g01-083-s02-00.png	The method of assessment to which the
g01-083-s02-01.png	Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax .
g01-083-s03-00.png	The manifest
g01-083-s03-01.png	injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
g01-083-s03-02.png	corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax ,
g01-083-s03-03.png	but this lesson was ignored , and the injustice trebled in
g01-083-s03-04.png	weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
g01-083-s03-05.png	had to pay three groats , but this time an adult was re-
g01-088-s00-00.png	Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
g01-088-s00-01.png	arithmetic which argued that , as the first
g01-088-s00-02.png	poll-tax had supplied 22,000 , a tax of
g01-088-s00-03.png	three times the rate would produce 66,000 .
g01-088-s01-00.png	The only concession made in view of the
g01-088-s01-01.png	objections to the first two poll-taxes was
g01-088-s01-02.png	the suggestion that the rich should help
g01-088-s01-03.png	the poor - but this was only a pious hope
g01-088-s01-04.png	because no machinery was provided for
g01-088-s01-05.png	carrying it into effect , and a subordinate
g02-059-s00-00.png	In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
g02-059-s00-01.png	from the dissection of living animals , showing how these move-
g02-059-s00-02.png	ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
g02-059-s00-03.png	or in flagging warmer ones .
g02-059-s01-00.png	At the time of its movement
g02-059-s01-01.png	the heart becomes generally constricted , its walls thicken ,
g02-059-s01-02.png	its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
g02-059-s01-03.png	content of blood , appearing paler in so doing in animals
g02-059-s01-04.png	such as serpents , frogs , and the like .
g02-062-s00-00.png	At one and the same time , therefore , occur the beat
g02-062-s00-01.png	of the apex , the thickening of the heart walls , and
g02-062-s00-02.png	the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
g02-062-s00-03.png	contraction of the ventricles .
g02-062-s01-00.png	Going on in Chapter Three
g02-062-s01-01.png	to the movement of the arteries , likewise gauged from
g02-062-s01-02.png	the dissections of living animals , Harvey noted that
g02-062-s01-03.png	contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
g02-062-s01-04.png	systole , simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
g02-062-s01-05.png	and of the artery-like vein , and expulsion of the
g02-062-s01-06.png	ventricular content .
g02-065-s00-00.png	Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of
g02-065-s01-00.png	ventricular contraction . During cutting or puncture of
g02-065-s01-01.png	the ventricles , there is often forcible expulsion
g02-065-s01-02.png	of blood from the wound .
g02-065-s02-00.png	Arterial diastole is
g02-065-s02-01.png	thus synchronous with cardiac systole but ,
g02-065-s02-02.png	when movement of blood through arteries is
g02-065-s02-03.png	hindered by compression , infarction or inter-
g02-065-s02-04.png	ception , the more distal arteries pulsate
g02-065-s02-05.png	less because their pulse is nothing other
g02-065-s02-06.png	than the impulse of the blood entering them .
g02-073-s00-00.png	' And while the heart is slowly dying ,
g02-073-s00-01.png	one can sometimes see it - so to speak
g02-073-s00-02.png	- rouse itself and , in reply to two or
g02-073-s00-03.png	three auricular beats , produce a single
g02-073-s00-04.png	ventricular one slowly and
g02-073-s00-05.png	reluctantly and with an effort . '

g03-000-s01-00.png	Yet in spite of the fact that his ideas did his
g03-000-s01-01.png	business no good George would never conceal them .
g03-000-s02-00.png	He was a socialist and believed in the right
g03-000-s02-01.png	of the working class to control their own destiny , and
g03-000-s02-02.png	said so .
g03-000-s03-00.png	Being a craftsman and a skilled man ,
g03-000-s03-01.png	George won many prizes , and though some people
g03-000-s03-02.png	would have nothing to do with him , others
g03-000-s03-03.png	would , and the comrades helped in many
g03-000-s03-04.png	ways .
g03-004-s00-00.png	When eventually the ovens were fixed at the new shop , the tremen-
g03-004-s00-01.png	dously hard work was if anything intensified .
g03-004-s01-00.png	George used to
g03-004-s01-01.png	mix 100 stone of bread in 12 hours , and Kate served in the
g03-004-s01-02.png	shop , which was open from 8 o'clock in the morning to
g03-004-s01-03.png	12 o'clock at night .
g03-004-s02-00.png	At that time pastries and buns
g03-004-s02-01.png	were sold at 32 pieces for one shilling .
g03-016-s00-00.png	( In this strike , as reported in the Sheffield
g03-016-s00-01.png	Guardian in March of that year , 1,000,000
g03-016-s00-02.png	men were out a fortnight , disciplined and solid ,
g03-016-s00-03.png	when only 20 per cent of them stood to gain
g03-016-s00-04.png	anything from the strike and the other 80 per
g03-016-s00-05.png	cent made sacrifices for their fellow men ;
g03-016-s00-06.png	this remarkable strike raised the question of a
g03-016-s00-07.png	living wage and showed the worth of the
g03-016-s00-08.png	common man . )
g03-032-s00-00.png	Soon they were good enough to sing at meetings .
g03-032-s01-00.png	One of the helpful by-products was that
g03-032-s01-01.png	they were able to obtain some respectable
g03-032-s01-02.png	clothing , with which they wore a white tie
g03-032-s01-03.png	and Red Flag badge , thus presenting a much
g03-032-s01-04.png	better appearance .
g03-032-s02-00.png	Later , on many a sunny Sunday
g03-032-s02-01.png	evening , when George went to speak at Malin Bridge ,
g03-032-s02-02.png	they would be there to begin the meeting .
g03-040-s00-00.png	As they became known the Choir went to working-
g03-040-s00-01.png	men's clubs , to Conisborough on cheap trips to
g03-040-s00-02.png	sing to the miners , and sang for other organisations such
g03-040-s00-03.png	as the Bakers' Union , for whom they went on Satur-
g03-040-s00-04.png	day evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel , to rally
g03-040-s00-05.png	the members .
g03-040-s01-00.png	The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms
g03-040-s01-01.png	on West Street , where a successful Sunday
g03-040-s01-02.png	school was held .
g03-043-s00-00.png	One of the students was young
g03-043-s00-01.png	George , and another the dark-haired
g03-043-s00-02.png	little granddaughter of Charlie Grant .
g03-043-s01-00.png	George often spoke at the Sunday school .
g03-043-s02-00.png	He christened the babies .
g03-043-s03-00.png	Also , when
g03-043-s03-01.png	called upon to do so , he would officiate
g03-043-s03-02.png	at funerals .
g03-043-s04-00.png	Religion was one of his pet
g03-043-s04-01.png	subjects , for being well acquainted
g03-043-s04-02.png	with the Bible , which he had
g03-043-s04-03.png	read in prison where it was the
g03-043-s04-04.png	only book they were allowed ,
g03-049-s00-00.png	Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
g03-049-s00-01.png	to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
g03-049-s00-02.png	with them , particularly those who , like the Rev.
g03-049-s00-03.png	Conrad Noel , the eloquent leader of
g03-049-s00-04.png	the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated
g03-049-s00-05.png	socialism .
g03-049-s01-00.png	With such men , who had the
g03-049-s01-01.png	courage of their convictions and their
g03-049-s01-02.png	Christianity , common ground could be found .
g03-052-s00-00.png	There was no abatement in political
g03-052-s00-01.png	work .
g03-052-s01-00.png	The British Socialist Party endea-
g03-052-s01-01.png	voured to get more socialist members sent to the
g03-052-s01-02.png	Council , and to Parliament , being deter-
g03-052-s01-03.png	mined and obdurate in their attitude that
g03-052-s01-04.png	their candidate must go forward in the
g03-052-s01-05.png	elections .
g03-052-s02-00.png	In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
g03-052-s02-01.png	Council meeting on October 16 , 1912 , George
g03-052-s02-02.png	had said ,
g03-052-s03-00.png	' Mr. Barton would go to the poll .
g03-052-s04-00.png	Just as the Labour Party had fought the
g03-052-s04-01.png	Liberals , they were going to fight the Labour
g03-058-s00-00.png	This new party , the British Socialist Party , was
g03-058-s00-01.png	not prepared to accept the role of junior helper
g03-058-s00-02.png	in the Labour movement , or of only providing
g03-058-s00-03.png	propaganda in order to increase the volume of
g03-058-s00-04.png	socialist thought in the city , but sought to create
g03-058-s00-05.png	in the Labour movement a more militant attitude
g03-058-s00-06.png	capable of achieving socialism for the working
g03-058-s00-07.png	people .
g03-064-s00-00.png	Alf Barton , who in 1911 was presented
g03-064-s00-01.png	with a book on the life of Marx ,
g03-064-s00-02.png	and a gold purse in recognition of his
g03-064-s00-03.png	work for the movement , was later
g03-064-s00-04.png	known to say that it was not ne-
g03-064-s00-05.png	cessary to understand Marxism in order to
g03-064-s00-06.png	understand socialism , though at this time
g03-064-s00-07.png	he was a keen member of the B.S.P. .
g04-003-s00-00.png	Dr. Davidson said he would go for
g04-003-s00-01.png	a walk over the fields while we attended
g04-003-s00-02.png	to our business .
g04-003-s01-00.png	To my amusement ,
g04-003-s01-01.png	when we met at tea at the rectory
g04-003-s01-02.png	after the Dedication , the Archbishop
g04-003-s01-03.png	said he had been stopped by
g04-003-s01-04.png	a farmer in a field .
g04-003-s02-00.png	He seemed
g04-003-s02-01.png	rather indignant , but we took the
g04-003-s02-02.png	episode without a smile till afterwards .
g04-007-s00-00.png	The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter
g04-007-s00-01.png	when the distance to the church deterred many from
g04-007-s00-02.png	coming to Sunday Evensong .
g04-007-s01-00.png	We managed to furnish
g04-007-s01-01.png	a table with cross and candles , and the people
g04-007-s01-02.png	appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
g04-007-s01-03.png	as for more secular purposes .
g04-007-s02-00.png	In 1910 Dr. Talbot
g04-007-s02-01.png	was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert
g04-007-s02-02.png	Burge became Bishop of Southwark .
g04-011-s00-00.png	Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
g04-011-s00-01.png	work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and
g04-011-s00-02.png	to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
g04-011-s00-03.png	Union .
g04-011-s01-00.png	This meant organizing lectures and courses of
g04-011-s01-01.png	religious instruction through the Diocese , and I
g04-011-s01-02.png	also found myself a member of the Diocesan
g04-011-s01-03.png	Conference , where I remember introducing myself as
g04-011-s01-04.png	the incumbent of the highest church in the
g04-011-s01-05.png	Diocese .
g04-014-s00-00.png	There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
g04-014-s00-01.png	some quarters , until I explained that my church
g04-014-s00-02.png	was 800 feet high above the sea level !
g04-014-s01-00.png	The
g04-014-s01-01.png	work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed
g04-014-s01-02.png	to get a stipendiary layman who could help
g04-014-s01-03.png	among the children and young people .
g04-017-s00-00.png	It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
g04-017-s00-01.png	in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play .
g04-017-s01-00.png	The place and its people were
g04-017-s01-01.png	to play an important part in my life .
g04-017-s02-00.png	For five years in succession till
g04-017-s02-01.png	war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became
g04-017-s02-02.png	very intimate with the people and the environs .
g04-017-s03-00.png	Every year between the
g04-017-s03-01.png	Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be
g04-017-s03-02.png	performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would
g04-017-s03-03.png	be discovered and trained .
g04-022-s00-00.png	After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit
g04-022-s00-01.png	Germany for ten years , by which time in
g04-022-s00-02.png	1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
g04-022-s01-00.png	Towards the end of my five and a half years'
g04-022-s01-01.png	incumbency I was asked if I would start
g04-022-s01-02.png	a village choral society and conduct it .
g04-022-s02-00.png	This opened up a new interest , and we plunged
g04-022-s02-01.png	into it .
g04-026-s00-00.png	First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
g04-026-s00-01.png	any idea of reading music .
g04-026-s01-00.png	This was the village doctor who was an
g04-026-s01-01.png	old school friend at Clifton .
g04-026-s02-00.png	He could sustain the tenor part quite well
g04-026-s02-01.png	and lead the others .
g04-026-s03-00.png	As for basses and altos the conductor had to
g04-026-s03-01.png	teach by singing the parts with them .
g04-026-s04-00.png	It was very amusing , and by
g04-026-s04-01.png	the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
g04-026-s04-02.png	could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
g04-032-s00-00.png	Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
g04-032-s00-01.png	Wedding Feast . '
g04-032-s01-00.png	Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we
g04-032-s01-01.png	gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,
g04-032-s01-02.png	and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
g04-032-s02-00.png	Friends from Limpsfield , in addition to the villagers , came up ,
g04-032-s02-01.png	and we were all happy .
g04-036-s00-00.png	IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as
g04-036-s00-01.png	Vicar of St. Mark's , Woodcote , Purley , a new church built
g04-036-s00-02.png	by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne ,
g04-036-s00-03.png	who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was
g04-036-s00-04.png	later on joint executor of his estate with his
g04-036-s00-05.png	solicitor cousin .
g04-036-s01-00.png	As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
g04-036-s01-01.png	ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held
g04-036-s01-02.png	great family consultations .
g04-039-s00-00.png	My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
g04-039-s00-01.png	his family , and found a very suitable house nearby
g04-039-s00-02.png	where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926
g04-039-s00-03.png	at the age of 92 .
g04-039-s01-00.png	Dr. Burge was not able to be present
g04-039-s01-01.png	at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
g04-039-s02-00.png	This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,
g04-039-s02-01.png	Dr. John Leake , who lived at Blackheath , and was
g04-039-s02-02.png	a close friend of ours .
g04-043-s00-00.png	But what a change from the dear little old church
g04-043-s00-01.png	at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
g04-043-s00-02.png	at Purley .
g04-043-s01-00.png	One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the
g04-043-s01-01.png	church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries
g04-043-s01-02.png	had been a House of Prayer .
g04-043-s02-00.png	I could not but feel the
g04-043-s02-01.png	chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is .
g04-043-s03-00.png	When we had found a group of people who gladly
g04-043-s03-01.png	co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place
g04-043-s03-02.png	of daily prayer .
g04-048-s00-00.png	I suggested to the congregation that it needed
g04-048-s00-01.png	warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we
g04-048-s00-02.png	found many to help .
g04-048-s01-00.png	Gifts of candlesticks and
g04-048-s01-01.png	stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
g04-048-s01-02.png	helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
g04-048-s01-03.png	for prayer and quiet .
g04-048-s02-00.png	In time we received similar
g04-048-s02-01.png	gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West
g04-048-s02-02.png	windows .
g04-052-s00-00.png	It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
g04-052-s00-01.png	such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
g04-052-s00-02.png	a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
g04-052-s00-03.png	the architect , himself a fine artist .
g04-052-s01-00.png	It is quite possible
g04-052-s01-01.png	to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
g04-052-s01-02.png	and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
g04-052-s01-03.png	table to the environs .
g04-055-s00-00.png	We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
g04-055-s00-01.png	the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses .
g04-055-s01-00.png	This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
g04-055-s01-01.png	there , but was soon changed into the better-
g04-055-s01-02.png	sounding name of Lansdowne Road .
g04-055-s02-00.png	There
g04-055-s02-01.png	were lots of children there , and we had
g04-055-s02-02.png	a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
g04-055-s02-03.png	service .
g04-055-s03-00.png	I soon saw that the parish needed
g04-055-s03-01.png	more help both at the church and Mission
g04-055-s03-02.png	district .
g04-060-s00-00.png	The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
g04-060-s00-01.png	Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the
g04-060-s00-02.png	church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
g04-060-s01-00.png	Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in
g04-060-s01-01.png	1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission
g04-060-s01-02.png	district and got to know , and be known by , many of
g04-060-s01-03.png	the people of the parish .
g04-063-s00-00.png	A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
g04-063-s00-01.png	year , 1914 , when war broke out .
g04-063-s01-00.png	Very soon Chaplains for
g04-063-s01-01.png	the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly
g04-063-s01-02.png	that one of us must volunteer .
g04-063-s02-00.png	The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did
g04-063-s02-01.png	not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish
g04-063-s02-02.png	for a year .
g04-063-s03-00.png	Mr. Evitt , however , was much less committed
g04-063-s03-01.png	than his Vicar , and he was accepted at once and
g04-063-s03-02.png	was very soon in France where he did splendid
g04-063-s03-03.png	work until his health broke down and he had a bad
g04-063-s03-04.png	attack of enteric fever .
g04-068-s00-00.png	Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
g04-068-s00-01.png	co-operation especially with the other Christian communities .
g04-068-s01-00.png	At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
g04-068-s01-01.png	' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees
g04-068-s01-02.png	I found myself deeply involved .
g04-068-s02-00.png	At first , the main work was to help
g04-068-s02-01.png	wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
g04-068-s02-02.png	allowances , but soon , alas ! , as casualties began and increased
g04-068-s02-03.png	in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
g04-068-s02-04.png	became very urgent , and I was asked to be Chairman
g04-068-s02-05.png	of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
g04-072-s00-00.png	Indeed , for the next seventeen years , during my time at
g04-072-s00-01.png	Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously
g04-072-s00-02.png	Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee .
g04-072-s01-00.png	This
g04-072-s01-01.png	task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
g04-072-s01-02.png	the Committee .
g04-072-s02-00.png	We had a splendid body of local residents ,
g04-072-s02-01.png	and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries .
g04-072-s03-00.png	Our
g04-072-s03-01.png	Committee met once a week in the evenings , and
g04-072-s03-02.png	included professional men from every walk of
g04-072-s03-03.png	life .
g04-077-s00-00.png	Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
g04-077-s00-01.png	were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen .
g04-077-s01-00.png	Life was
g04-077-s01-01.png	in those years more than busy .
g04-077-s02-00.png	We now had a vicarage next
g04-077-s02-01.png	to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight
g04-077-s02-02.png	years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
g04-077-s02-03.png	well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
g04-077-s02-04.png	church .
g04-081-s00-00.png	On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
g04-081-s00-01.png	Purley she offered to come and look after me .
g04-081-s01-00.png	She was
g04-081-s01-01.png	a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic
g04-081-s01-02.png	things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '
g04-081-s01-03.png	who was the only other occupant of the house when
g04-081-s01-04.png	Mr. Evitt had gone .
g04-088-s00-00.png	We gathered together a splendid Sunday
g04-088-s00-01.png	afternoon service at the church , each child
g04-088-s00-02.png	being given a number which , as they came into
g04-088-s00-03.png	church , they could just whisper to
g04-088-s00-04.png	the superintendent who filled in the regi-
g04-088-s00-05.png	ster at her own home .
g04-088-s01-00.png	Each child had a
g04-088-s01-01.png	picture given them and the lesson was
g04-088-s01-02.png	largely based on this .
g04-088-s02-00.png	It was on a
g04-088-s02-01.png	stamp which could be stuck in
g04-088-s02-02.png	their book , and there was quite a
g04-088-s02-03.png	clamour for back stamps if a child
g04-088-s02-04.png	had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
g04-092-s00-00.png	It was quite amusing to see how much
g04-092-s00-01.png	the children enjoyed the service , and I heard
g04-092-s00-02.png	of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
g04-092-s00-03.png	naughty child with the penalty of not being
g04-092-s00-04.png	allowed to come to the Children's Church
g04-092-s00-05.png	on Sunday afternoon .
g04-092-s01-00.png	I hope the threat
g04-092-s01-01.png	kept them good in the week , but anyway
g04-092-s01-02.png	they were a most delightful lot , and
g04-092-s01-03.png	it is a great joy to meet them now
g04-092-s01-04.png	fifty years afterwards when so many
g04-092-s01-05.png	are parents or even grandparents
g04-095-s00-00.png	Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
g04-095-s00-01.png	me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
g04-095-s00-02.png	lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
g04-095-s00-03.png	continuing till old age to-day .
g04-095-s01-00.png	When I went
g04-095-s01-01.png	to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was
g04-095-s01-02.png	with the Vicar's Warden , Mr. F. W. Charlton
g04-095-s01-03.png	and his family , the youngest of whose three
g04-095-s01-04.png	sons was just coming into the world in this year
g04-095-s01-05.png	of 1913 .
g04-098-s00-00.png	From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
g04-098-s00-01.png	deep friendship which I have taken with me through
g04-098-s00-02.png	all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry .
g04-098-s01-00.png	Mr. and
g04-098-s01-01.png	Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
g04-098-s01-02.png	years of war , when most lives were upset and
g04-098-s01-03.png	some tempers were easily frayed , the most
g04-098-s01-04.png	loyal and devoted friends .
g04-101-s00-00.png	Their homes - for since those years they have
g04-101-s00-01.png	lived on in Purley - have always been
g04-101-s00-02.png	havens of rest , and the welcome has never
g04-101-s00-03.png	failed .
g04-101-s01-00.png	Their three boys , now successful men ,
g04-101-s01-01.png	were in our Children's Church from the
g04-101-s01-02.png	outset , and when we don't see one
g04-101-s01-03.png	another we do not forget .
g04-104-s00-00.png	In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full
g04-104-s00-01.png	both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
g04-104-s01-00.png	The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in
g04-104-s01-01.png	Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards
g04-104-s01-02.png	at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners .
g04-104-s02-00.png	I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them
g04-104-s02-01.png	frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with
g04-104-s02-02.png	the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
g04-104-s02-03.png	someone who knew their native villages .
g04-108-s00-00.png	I could at once notice the great antagonism
g04-108-s00-01.png	between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
g04-108-s00-02.png	scorned these more simple country folk .
g05-087-s00-00.png	Less than no response from the Russian side led
g05-087-s00-01.png	one to fear that the event might well have the
g05-087-s00-02.png	outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
g05-087-s00-03.png	lead to disaster .
g05-087-s01-00.png	Then there had been much talk of
g05-087-s01-01.png	the setting up among the German population of a
g05-087-s01-02.png	general system of francs-tireurs , to be named
g05-087-s01-03.png	 Werewolves .
g05-094-s00-00.png	The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
g05-094-s00-01.png	more than a fantasy .
g05-094-s01-00.png	Thanks to the good
g05-094-s01-01.png	sense of the front line soldiers , the
g05-094-s01-02.png	meeting of East and West was marked by
g05-094-s01-03.png	the use of no weapon more lethal than
g05-094-s01-04.png	vodka .
g05-094-s02-00.png	And the effect on the German people
g05-094-s02-01.png	of the first ten years of the promised
g05-094-s02-02.png	thousand of Nazi rule , so far from creating
g05-094-s02-03.png	a spirit of warlike frenzy , had produced
g05-094-s02-04.png	universally a dull bewildered apathy .
g05-098-s00-00.png	So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
g05-098-s00-01.png	 Werewolves that we had contemplated the necessity of very
g05-098-s00-02.png	special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen .
g05-098-s01-00.png	Particular
g05-098-s01-01.png	hatred , we felt , was bound to be aimed at the representatives of
g05-098-s01-02.png	those who had , over the years , spread such ghastly havoc , destruction
g05-098-s01-03.png	and death over Germany , causing such wholesale slaughter among
g05-098-s01-04.png	men , women and children , old and young alike .

g06-089-s00-00.png	Later in the year , the idea of some sort of
g06-089-s00-01.png	public employment was again in the air .
g06-089-s01-00.png	Lady
g06-089-s01-01.png	Cowper , for instance , told Princess Lieven on
g06-089-s01-02.png	September 25th that Anglesey was very much
g06-089-s01-03.png	annoyed at not obtaining the Admiralty in place
g06-089-s01-04.png	of Lord Auckland , who had gone to govern India .
g06-089-s02-00.png	If there was any truth in this , Lord Melbourne's
g06-089-s02-01.png	letter of the following day , offering Anglesey the
g06-089-s02-02.png	Government of Gibraltar , may have been a
g06-089-s02-03.png	sop .
g06-093-s00-00.png	' It is ' , he wrote , ' one of the best military situations
g06-093-s00-01.png	which the Crown has to bestow - the salary has

g06-093-s01-02.png	impossible that you might be willing to accept of
g06-093-s01-03.png	this appointment . '
g06-096-s00-00.png	The reply was not bereft of asperity :
g06-096-s01-00.png	' Beaudesert ,
g06-096-s01-01.png	Sept. 27 , 1835
g06-096-s02-00.png	' Dear Melbourne , ' I have received
g06-096-s02-01.png	your letter of yesterday .
g06-096-s03-00.png	' I am not prepared to spend
g06-096-s03-01.png	the remainder of my life at Gibraltar , & moreover
g06-096-s03-02.png	( if even residence were not the condition ) , having
g06-096-s03-03.png	no taste for a sinecure , I have only to thank
g06-096-s03-04.png	you for the offer & to decline it .
g06-101-s00-00.png	' I remain , dear Melbourne , faithfully yours , ' ANGLESEY '
g06-101-s01-00.png	Soon after his return from Europe , Clarence Paget
g06-101-s01-01.png	had become seriously ill with a supposed abscess
g06-101-s01-02.png	on the lungs .
g06-101-s02-00.png	After months of suffering , his life was
g06-101-s02-01.png	almost despaired of when as a last resort it was
g06-101-s02-02.png	suggested that the patient should be taken to consult
g06-101-s02-03.png	Hahnemann once again .
g06-105-s00-00.png	It was no longer necessary to go further than Paris ,
g06-105-s00-01.png	for by this time the great man had been driven
g06-105-s00-02.png	from his native Germany by the antipathy of his
g06-105-s00-03.png	orthodox brethren .
g06-105-s01-00.png	The main difficulty was how to
g06-105-s01-01.png	make the expedition from England without killing the
g06-105-s01-02.png	patient before he completed it .
g06-105-s02-00.png	The problem was
g06-105-s02-01.png	overcome in an interesting manner .
g06-109-s00-00.png	' Fortunately , ' wrote Clarence in after years , ' the
g06-109-s00-01.png	King ... remembered there was a luxurious old bed
g06-109-s00-02.png	travelling-carriage in the royal coach-houses , which
g06-109-s00-03.png	had carried his brother , George 4 . , and he kindly
g06-109-s00-04.png	placed it at the disposal of my father .
g06-109-s01-00.png	Into it I was
g06-109-s01-01.png	put , more dead than alive , and we got across to
g06-109-s01-02.png	Calais , and from thence by easy stages to
g06-109-s01-03.png	Paris ...
g06-115-s00-00.png	He wrote down every symptom , examined me all
g06-115-s00-01.png	over , asked ever so many questions which I had
g06-115-s00-02.png	scarcely strength to answer , and took up his gold-
g06-115-s00-03.png	headed cane to depart .
g06-115-s01-00.png	My father hung upon every
g06-115-s01-01.png	word , but could get nothing from him .

g07-007b-s00-00.png	In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and

g07-007b-s01-02.png	the Pilgrim had most treasured , scattered on the floor , -
g07-007b-s01-03.png	as rubbish of no marketable value , and trampled on ' .
g07-010b-s00-00.png	This was to give colour to his pretext for copying Byron's last

g07-010b-s00-02.png	destination had seemed slight .

g07-014b-s02-02.png	sure that no recent will was amongst them .
g07-018a-s00-00.png	It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do
g07-018a-s00-01.png	his copying .
g07-018a-s01-00.png	Considering that Pietro was not above
g07-018a-s01-01.png	twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load
g07-018a-s01-02.png	of heavy responsibilities , his conduct reveals him as
g07-018a-s01-03.png	one of the most intelligent as well as the most
g07-018a-s01-04.png	sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece .
g07-018a-s02-00.png	With
g07-018a-s02-01.png	his good looks - for he ' carried the passport of a very
g07-018a-s02-02.png	handsome person ' - his good manners and his perfect
g07-018a-s02-03.png	lack of pretension , he even succeeded in disarming
g07-018a-s02-04.png	Hobhouse's possessiveness and making him forget how
g07-018a-s02-05.png	deeply he had disapproved , less than two years
g07-022a-s00-00.png	Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed ,
g07-022a-s00-01.png	and wrote to Lady Byron after she had
g07-022a-s00-02.png	received a visit from him :
g07-022a-s01-00.png	I have today seen
g07-022a-s01-01.png	Count Gamba - which was very distressing
g07-022a-s01-02.png	for many reasons but quite unavoidable - he
g07-022a-s01-03.png	is a pleasing , fine looking young man &
g07-022a-s01-04.png	spoke with great feeling .
g07-022a-s02-00.png	The unfortunate
g07-022a-s02-01.png	Augusta was in one of her worst states of
g07-022a-s02-02.png	confusion .
g07-022b-s00-00.png	Augusta Leigh too was favourably impressed , and wrote
g07-022b-s00-01.png	to Lady Byron after she had received a visit from
g07-022b-s00-02.png	him :
g07-022b-s01-00.png	I have today seen Count Gamba - which was very
g07-022b-s01-01.png	distressing for many reasons but quite unavoidable -

g07-022b-s01-03.png	with great feeling .
g07-022b-s02-00.png	The unfortunate Augusta was
g07-022b-s02-01.png	in one of her worst states of confusion .
g07-026a-s00-00.png	She had loved Byron , but she had
g07-026a-s00-01.png	betrayed him , betrayed him not twice , as
g07-026a-s00-02.png	he had betrayed her , but again and again
g07-026a-s00-03.png	over a long span of time , fawning on his
g07-026a-s00-04.png	implacable wife , purveying to her in secret
g07-026a-s00-05.png	the unguarded letters he never suspected
g07-026a-s00-06.png	any eye but her own would see , feeding
g07-026a-s00-07.png	the stealthy fires of her animosity : and
g07-026a-s00-08.png	having betrayed him , she had grown to fear
g07-026a-s00-09.png	and almost to hate him .
g07-026b-s00-00.png	She had loved Byron , but she had betrayed him ,
g07-026b-s00-01.png	betrayed him not twice , as he had betrayed her ,
g07-026b-s00-02.png	but again and again over a long span of time ,
g07-026b-s00-03.png	fawning on his implacable wife , purveying to her
g07-026b-s00-04.png	in secret the unguarded letters he never

g07-026b-s00-06.png	feeding the stealthy fires of her animosity :
g07-026b-s00-07.png	and having betrayed him , she had grown to
g07-026b-s00-08.png	fear and almost to hate him .
g07-028a-s00-00.png	She had dreaded his outpourings of affection
g07-028a-s00-01.png	for her in poetry that he thought would clear
g07-028a-s00-02.png	her and that only compromised her , and the
g07-028a-s00-03.png	headstrong folly that tempted him to write on
g07-028a-s00-04.png	ever more daring themes , teaching the world
g07-028a-s00-05.png	to guess what repentance and unrepentance
g07-028a-s00-06.png	preyed upon his thoughts .
g07-028b-s00-00.png	She had dreaded his outpourings of affection for
g07-028b-s00-01.png	her in poetry that he thought would clear
g07-028b-s00-02.png	her and that only compromised her , and #
g07-028b-s00-03.png	the headstrong folly that tempted him to
g07-028b-s00-04.png	write on ever more daring themes , teaching
g07-028b-s00-05.png	the world to guess what repentance and
g07-028b-s00-06.png	unrepentance preyed upon his thoughts .
g07-030-s00-00.png	She had dreaded still more that he might
g07-030-s00-01.png	return to England , overshadowing her again
g07-030-s00-02.png	with spiritual and social peril .
g07-030-s01-00.png	But this kind
g07-030-s01-01.png	of return was what she could never have
g07-030-s01-02.png	foreseen ... that he # should come back not
g07-030-s01-03.png	voluble but silent , not beautiful but defaced ,
g07-030-s01-04.png	not in obloquy but with his praises ringing !
g07-030-s02-00.png	She could remember now his exciting laughter ,
g07-030-s02-01.png	his almost filial love for her , her almost
g07-030-s02-02.png	maternal love for him .
g07-034-s00-00.png	Above all she could remember the anguish of their
g07-034-s00-01.png	parting , and how he had been ' convulsed , absolutely
g07-034-s00-02.png	convulsed with grief ' .
g07-034-s01-00.png	So love revived , and in
g07-034-s01-01.png	its most sentimental form .
g07-034-s02-00.png	While he lived
g07-034-s02-01.png	she had lost touch in her perpetual alarms
g07-034-s02-02.png	with what was best in him ; dead his memory
g07-034-s02-03.png	became sacred to her .
g07-038-s00-00.png	She felt almost as strongly as Hobhouse
g07-038-s00-01.png	# about biographies .
g07-038-s01-00.png	Quite apart from the
g07-038-s01-01.png	divagations of her ' poor brother ' - so she
g07-038-s01-02.png	constantly referred to him - there were a
g07-038-s01-03.png	hundred reasons why it would be
g07-038-s01-04.png	objectionable to have the family history
g07-038-s01-05.png	exposed .
g07-038-s02-00.png	Whatever latitude she allowed in
g07-038-s02-01.png	the warmth of her kindly nature to others -
g07-038-s02-02.png	or to herself - she believed implicitly in
g07-038-s02-03.png	the moral code she had learned from
g07-038-s02-04.png	her good grandmother , the Countess of
g07-042-s00-00.png	She had no desire to see in print that her
g07-042-s00-01.png	mother , who was to have been a duchess , had
g07-042-s00-02.png	been involved in a scandalous and ruinous
g07-042-s00-03.png	divorce , that her father , ' Mad Jack Byron ' , was
g07-042-s00-04.png	a profligate and a bankrupt who had
g07-042-s00-05.png	squandered every penny two successive wives
g07-042-s00-06.png	had brought him and left the second on
g07-042-s00-07.png	the verge of destitution , and that he had died
g07-042-s00-08.png	a drunkard and perhaps a suicide , hiding
g07-042-s00-09.png	in France to escape his creditors .
g07-044-s00-00.png	It was no more pleasant for the Hon. Augusta
g07-044-s00-01.png	Leigh to share this kind of story with the world
g07-044-s00-02.png	than it would be for most 20th-century ladies
g07-044-s00-03.png	moving in court circles and having children to
g07-044-s00-04.png	be settled advantageously in life .
g07-044-s01-00.png	She had lived
g07-044-s01-01.png	down the rumours which had made the year of
g07-044-s01-02.png	the Byron separation a nightmare to her , and she
g07-044-s01-03.png	had also succeeded , though with an increasing
g07-044-s01-04.png	sense of effort , in persuading her little world to
g07-044-s01-05.png	avert its eyes from her husband , ' that drone ' ,
g07-044-s01-06.png	as # Byron called him , whose career of
g07-047-s00-00.png	She had earned the right to be left in peace .
g07-047-s01-00.png	Byron's fame was , of course , very wonderful , but
g07-047-s01-01.png	it carried with it too many reminders of his
g07-047-s01-02.png	terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan ,
g07-047-s01-03.png	which she had never ceased to deplore , his
g07-047-s01-04.png	shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement ,
g07-047-s01-05.png	his making friends with the atheist known to
g07-047-s01-06.png	her as ' that infamous Mr. Shelley ' , and his
g07-047-s01-07.png	mixing with really low and horrid people such
g07-047-s01-08.png	as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt , whom
g07-047-s01-09.png	on would never conceivably meet in decent society .
g07-050-s00-00.png	She was most emphatically opposed to the
g07-050-s00-01.png	production of sheer indelicacies , and that was
g07-050-s00-02.png	the light in which she saw the proposed book
g07-050-s00-03.png	by Dallas .
g07-050-s01-00.png	Letters between a mother and a son -
g07-050-s01-01.png	a son so outspoken and a mother so far from
g07-050-s01-02.png	suitable to be paraded before the public !
g07-050-s02-00.png	And brought out by that seedy poor relation ,
g07-050-s02-01.png	Dallas !
g07-050-s03-00.png	Could anything be in worse taste ?
g07-065-s00-00.png	Hanson , the solicitor , was naturally remunerated
g07-065-s00-01.png	for his services , but all Mr Hobhouse's duties
g07-065-s00-02.png	as executor were performed without reward .
g07-065-s01-00.png	And now there was more trouble brewing
g07-065-s01-01.png	with those unbearable Dallases .
g07-065-s02-00.png	Dallas
g07-065-s02-01.png	senior was detained in Paris by severe
g07-065-s02-02.png	illness , but Dallas junior was full of
g07-065-s02-03.png	fight and applying for the injunction
g07-065-s02-04.png	to be lifted .
g07-069a-s00-00.png	He had gone to Byron's cousin , now 7th
g07-069a-s00-01.png	lord , and had got him to compose an
g07-069a-s00-02.png	affidavit to the effect that , whereas he
g07-069a-s00-03.png	had formerly been reluctant to approve the
g07-069a-s00-04.png	publication unless it had first been
g07-069a-s00-05.png	examined by the relatives and friends of
g07-069a-s00-06.png	his predecessor , he had now read the
g07-069a-s00-07.png	book and was content for it to be
g07-069a-s00-08.png	issued without that precaution .
g07-071a-s00-00.png	There were few things in Augusta's whole
g07-071a-s00-01.png	life , full of calamities though it was , that
g07-071a-s00-02.png	hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
g07-071a-s00-03.png	from George Anson Byron , whom she had
g07-071a-s00-04.png	loved with an unswerving loyalty , and had looked
g07-071a-s00-05.png	on as her intimate friend .
g07-071a-s01-00.png	Moreover , he
g07-071a-s01-01.png	was without the right to make such
g07-071a-s01-02.png	pronouncements : he had inherited nothing
g07-071a-s01-03.png	from her brother but his title , whereas
g07-071a-s01-04.png	she was not only of nearer consanguinity
g07-071a-s01-05.png	but the chosen recipient of his property .
g07-074a-s00-00.png	These , if she had only known it , were
g07-074a-s00-01.png	precisely the reasons why her cousin took
g07-074a-s00-02.png	pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her .
g07-074a-s01-00.png	Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
g07-074a-s01-01.png	intimate friends , and in every instance where
g07-074a-s01-02.png	the occasion was granted her , she managed
g07-074a-s01-03.png	to find some excuse for bestowing , in whole
g07-074a-s01-04.png	or in part , those confidences which never
g07-074a-s01-05.png	failed to leave her audience agape with
g07-074a-s01-06.png	wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's
g07-074a-s01-07.png	wickedness .
g07-077a-s00-00.png	George Anson Byron had seen enough of
g07-077a-s00-01.png	the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband
g07-077a-s00-02.png	to be aware that Augusta , so far from
g07-077a-s00-03.png	being responsible for the collapse of the
g07-077a-s00-04.png	marriage , had been Lady Byron's greatest
g07-077a-s00-05.png	support and comfort at the time ; but it
g07-077a-s00-06.png	had been deemed necessary all the
g07-077a-s00-07.png	same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
g07-077a-s00-08.png	in the background , and he had repeated
g07-077a-s00-09.png	them to his newly married wife .
g07-079a-s00-00.png	Their friendship for Augusta became rather
g07-079a-s00-01.png	hollow , and the news that Byron had left
g07-079a-s00-02.png	her practically all his money caused it to
g07-079a-s00-03.png	crumble to oblivion .
g07-079a-s01-00.png	Though Lady Byron
g07-079a-s01-01.png	knew perfectly well that Byron , as early
g07-079a-s01-02.png	as the year of their wedding , 1815 , had
g07-079a-s01-03.png	made a will in Augusta's favour , she had
g07-079a-s01-04.png	evidently not passed on that information ;
g07-079a-s01-05.png	and it came as an appalling surprise to
g07-079a-s01-06.png	Captain Byron that he had been left
g07-079a-s01-07.png	without the fortune that would keep up the
g07-079a-s01-08.png	title .
g07-084-s00-00.png	' Respecting the will ' , he wrote to Byron's widow a few days after
g07-084-s00-01.png	hearing its contents , ' the very thought of it is painful to me .
g07-084-s01-00.png	What Mary has said about it is too true . '
g07-084-s02-00.png	What Mary , the
g07-084-s02-01.png	new Lady Byron , had said about it was written on the first half
g07-084-s02-02.png	sheet of the same paper :
g07-084-s03-00.png	My dearest Annabella , The more we
g07-084-s03-01.png	consider the most prominent subject in your letter , the more
g07-084-s03-02.png	we are convinced of the truth of that dreadful history
g07-084-s03-03.png	connected with it .
h01-000-s00-00.png	Questions about marriage and children were
h01-000-s00-01.png	again included , as they had been at the
h01-000-s00-02.png	1911 and 1951 Censuses .
h01-000-s01-00.png	The former had asked
h01-000-s01-01.png	for marriage details for all married women ,
h01-000-s01-02.png	the latter for all married women under
h01-000-s01-03.png	the age of 50 .
h01-000-s02-00.png	The 1961 Census questions
h01-000-s02-01.png	related to all women who were or had been
h01-000-s02-02.png	married , and so repeated the enquiry made
h01-000-s02-03.png	fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family
h01-000-s02-04.png	Census conducted on behalf of the Royal
h01-000-s02-05.png	Commission on Population .
h01-004-s00-00.png	The questions about children were the same as in 1951 ,
h01-004-s00-01.png	except that they extended to all women who were or had
h01-004-s00-02.png	been married .
h01-004-s01-00.png	It was not regarded as practicable within
h01-004-s01-01.png	the limits of the census to include particulars about
h01-004-s01-02.png	the date of birth of each child , as had been done
h01-004-s01-03.png	in the specialised enquiry for the Royal Commission .
h01-007-s00-00.png	The innovation at the 1961 Census , though the
h01-007-s00-01.png	Family Census had previously included
h01-007-s00-02.png	the question , was the date of termination
h01-007-s00-03.png	of the first or only marriage .
h01-007-s01-00.png	This enables
h01-007-s01-01.png	statistical use to be made of their experience
h01-007-s01-02.png	as regards duration of marriage and
h01-007-s01-03.png	number of children in the case of women
h01-007-s01-04.png	whose first or only marriage was terminated
h01-007-s01-05.png	by widowhood or divorce after the end
h01-007-s01-06.png	of their child bearing life .
h01-010-s00-00.png	This is particularly important in estimating the trends
h01-010-s00-01.png	in the size and pattern of families for successive
h01-010-s00-02.png	generations over as long a period as possible , as the
h01-010-s00-03.png	proportion of widows predominates in the higher age
h01-010-s00-04.png	groups .
h01-010-s01-00.png	In Wales and Monmouthshire the question
h01-010-s01-01.png	on the ability to speak Welsh was included as
h01-010-s01-02.png	previously .
h01-010-s02-00.png	The question was first asked in 1891 , and
h01-010-s02-01.png	was given its present form in 1931 .
h01-014-s00-00.png	Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
h01-014-s00-01.png	about housing and households .
h01-014-s01-00.png	In 1961 the scope of the
h01-014-s01-01.png	question was wider than before , because of the great
h01-014-s01-02.png	use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local
h01-014-s01-03.png	Government and to local authorities .
h01-014-s02-00.png	As before , the record
h01-014-s02-01.png	made during the enumeration lists all buildings , residen-
h01-014-s02-02.png	tial premises and temporary places of abode , and all
h01-014-s02-03.png	households occupying them , as the basis of the
h01-014-s02-04.png	enumeration is the household schedule .
h01-018-s00-00.png	The number of structurally separate dwellings ( that is ,
h01-018-s00-01.png	houses or flats or other quarters built or adapted for
h01-018-s00-02.png	separate occupation and forming a private and structurally
h01-018-s00-03.png	separate unit ) was obtained as previously , together with the
h01-018-s00-04.png	number of households with sole occupation or sharing
h01-018-s00-05.png	such dwellings , and the number of living rooms occu-
h01-018-s00-06.png	pied by each household .
h01-024-s00-00.png	A new question asked about housing tenure , whether
h01-024-s00-01.png	the accommodation occupied by each household was held by
h01-024-s00-02.png	them as owner-occupiers ; occupied in connection with
h01-024-s00-03.png	employment or as part of business premises ; rented
h01-024-s00-04.png	from a Council ( or New Town Corporation ) or a private
h01-024-s00-05.png	landlord ( if so , whether furnished or unfurnished ) ; or

h01-024-s01-00.png	The analysis of private
h01-024-s01-01.png	households by size and various characteristics of their
h01-024-s01-02.png	members has become increasingly important .
h01-027-s00-00.png	Previously , while visitors were left out of this
h01-027-s00-01.png	analysis it was not considered sufficiently
h01-027-s00-02.png	important to attempt the task of bringing
h01-027-s00-03.png	in the members away from home on Census
h01-027-s00-04.png	night , which would be very laborious in the
h01-027-s00-05.png	absence of information given at their place
h01-027-s00-06.png	of usual residence ( n
h01-027-s01-00.png	But the need
h01-027-s01-01.png	for a more accurate distribution of
h01-027-s01-02.png	households by size as usually constituted
h01-027-s01-03.png	had become more important by 1961 , and
h01-027-s01-04.png	accordingly a new question was introduced , ...
h01-030-s00-00.png	The information collected under
h01-030-s00-01.png	this head will not affect the
h01-030-s00-02.png	main count of population numbers ,
h01-030-s00-03.png	but will be used solely in the
h01-030-s00-04.png	analysis of households by size
h01-030-s00-05.png	and other characteristics .
h01-030-s01-00.png	Sample . -
h01-030-s02-00.png	At an early stage of the census
h01-030-s02-01.png	preparations consideration was
h01-030-s02-02.png	given to possibilities of reducing
h01-030-s02-03.png	the amount of clerical work before ...
h02-004-s00-00.png	We have held eleven meetings .
h02-004-s01-00.png	We decided as a
h02-004-s01-01.png	first step to seek information from a number
h02-004-s01-02.png	of organisations and persons having an interest
h02-004-s01-03.png	in the questions before us and at a later stage we
h02-004-s01-04.png	arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
h02-004-s01-05.png	anybody interested to submit representations .
h02-004-s02-00.png	We
h02-004-s02-01.png	compiled a list of the points which we thought
h02-004-s02-02.png	were of importance , but we made it clear that
h02-004-s02-03.png	the replies need not be confined to these
h02-004-s02-04.png	particular items .
h02-008-s00-00.png	As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence , though
h02-008-s00-01.png	we found it an advantage in certain instances .
h02-008-s01-00.png	Appendix
h02-008-s01-01.png	1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted .
h02-008-s02-00.png	The
h02-008-s02-01.png	Department of Health for Scotland , the Home Office and
h02-008-s02-02.png	the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us ;
h02-008-s02-03.png	officers of these Departments attended our meetings
h02-008-s02-04.png	and have given us valuable assistance .
h02-012-s00-00.png	On 23rd November , 1959 , we submitted
h02-012-s00-01.png	an Interim Report .
h02-012-s01-00.png	This dealt with two questions
h02-012-s01-01.png	which arose from our terms of reference and
h02-012-s01-02.png	which had been brought specially to our notice .
h02-012-s02-00.png	First , we were asked to examine the risks
h02-012-s02-01.png	attending the abuse of carbromal and
h02-012-s02-02.png	bromvaletone and preparations containing these
h02-012-s02-03.png	substances .
h02-012-s03-00.png	The Poisons Board had already
h02-012-s03-01.png	considered this problem but , in the absence of
h02-012-s03-02.png	sufficient evidence that these compounds
h02-017-s00-00.png	4 . On examination of the evidence it became clear
h02-017-s00-01.png	to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
h02-017-s00-02.png	of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
h02-017-s00-03.png	were not appropriate for restriction to supply on
h02-017-s00-04.png	prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act , 1951 ,
h02-017-s00-05.png	or the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1956 , and had
h02-017-s00-06.png	not so far been recommended for control as
h02-017-s00-07.png	poisons .
h02-019-s00-00.png	5 . We recommended that , in general , any drug or
h02-019-s00-01.png	pharmaceutical preparation which has an action on the
h02-019-s00-02.png	central nervous system and is liable to produce physical
h02-019-s00-03.png	or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply
h02-019-s00-04.png	on prescription and that an independent expert body
h02-019-s00-05.png	should be responsible for advising which substances
h02-019-s00-06.png	should be so controlled .
h02-019-s01-00.png	6 . As an interim and urgent
h02-019-s01-01.png	measure , the Secretary of State for the Home Department ,
h02-019-s01-02.png	on the recommendation of the Poisons Board , has
h02-022-s00-00.png	We are glad to note the action that has been taken
h02-022-s00-01.png	and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure
h02-022-s00-02.png	that , as other preparations affecting the central nervous
h02-022-s00-03.png	system become available , they too will be brought to
h02-022-s00-04.png	the notice of the Poisons Board , or such other advisory
h02-022-s00-05.png	body as may in due course be appointed for the
h02-022-s00-06.png	purpose , to consider whether there are sufficient
h02-022-s00-07.png	grounds for restricting any of them also to supply
h02-022-s00-08.png	on prescription .
h02-024-s00-00.png	8 . The second part of our Interim Report was
h02-024-s00-01.png	devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted
h02-024-s00-02.png	to the gases and vapours which they use in the
h02-024-s00-03.png	course of their professional duties .
h02-024-s01-00.png	We
h02-024-s01-01.png	ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
h02-024-s01-02.png	ity was very small indeed .
h02-024-s02-00.png	However , over a
h02-024-s02-01.png	period of eleven years , patients' lives had been
h02-024-s02-02.png	endangered in two known instances .
h02-028-s00-00.png	We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
h02-028-s00-01.png	subject that , with the apparatus at present to hand , the
h02-028-s00-02.png	preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
h02-028-s00-03.png	administering them to a patient was a recognised and
h02-028-s00-04.png	necessary precaution .
h02-028-s01-00.png	We accepted this .
h02-028-s02-00.png	10 . In view of
h02-028-s02-01.png	the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
h02-028-s02-02.png	anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
h02-028-s02-03.png	to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
h02-028-s02-04.png	entrusted with their administration .
h02-035-s00-00.png	The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee , whose advice
h02-035-s00-01.png	we were invited to review , were to advise on : ( a ) the
h02-035-s00-02.png	circumstances , if any , in which the supply of morphine
h02-035-s00-03.png	and heroin , and preparations containing these substances ,
h02-035-s00-04.png	to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
h02-035-s00-05.png	as medically advisable ; ( b ) the precautions which medical
h02-035-s00-06.png	practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
h02-035-s00-07.png	heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
h02-035-s00-08.png	administrative measures that seemed expedient to
h02-035-s00-09.png	secure observance of those precautions .
h02-037-s00-00.png	12 . Through the system of records and
h02-037-s00-01.png	inspection then in operation cases were
h02-037-s00-02.png	brought to the notice of the Home Office
h02-037-s00-03.png	at that time in which exceptionally
h02-037-s00-04.png	large quantities of morphine and heroin
h02-037-s00-05.png	had been supplied to particular practi-
h02-037-s00-06.png	tioners or prescribed for individual
h02-037-s00-07.png	cases .
h02-037-s01-00.png	On further enquiry it was
h02-037-s01-01.png	ascertained that sometimes the
h02-037-s01-02.png	doctor had ordered these drugs simply
h02-040-s00-00.png	13 . It appeared then that in some circumstances
h02-040-s00-01.png	dangerous drugs were being supplied in
h02-040-s00-02.png	contravention of the intention of Parliament
h02-040-s00-03.png	that a doctor should be authorised to supply
h02-040-s00-04.png	drugs only so far as was necessary for the
h02-040-s00-05.png	practice of his profession .
h02-040-s01-00.png	Before deciding on
h02-040-s01-01.png	measures to secure proper observance of
h02-040-s01-02.png	the law , it was felt necessary to have
h02-040-s01-03.png	some authoritative medical advice on various
h02-040-s01-04.png	aspects of the treatment of addiction , ...
h02-043-s00-00.png	The Rolleston Committee's recommen-
h02-043-s00-01.png	dations in 1926 on the supply of morphine
h02-043-s00-02.png	and heroin to addicts to these drugs and
h02-043-s00-03.png	on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed
h02-043-s00-04.png	later in this Report .
h02-043-s01-00.png	They have , up to now ,
h02-043-s01-01.png	been included in the Memorandum on
h02-043-s01-02.png	the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations
h02-043-s01-03.png	which is prepared by the Home Office
h02-043-s01-04.png	for the information of doctors and
h02-043-s01-05.png	dentists .
h02-049-s00-00.png	The Secretary of State was empowered , on the recommendation of a
h02-049-s00-01.png	tribunal , to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply
h02-049-s00-02.png	dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor , or a doctor
h02-049-s00-03.png	convicted of an offence under the Act , should not issue
h02-049-s00-04.png	prescriptions for dangerous drugs .
h02-049-s01-00.png	( 3 ) It was made clear
h02-049-s01-01.png	that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
h02-049-s01-02.png	medical practitioner when required for purposes of
h02-049-s01-03.png	medical treatment .
h04-000-s00-00.png	Nevertheless , average net family income
h04-000-s00-01.png	was appreciably higher in families with
h04-000-s00-02.png	several children than in those with only ,
h04-000-s00-03.png	many of which were incomplete families
h04-000-s00-04.png	of younger parents with lower earnings ,
h04-000-s00-05.png	and of course with lower tax reliefs and
h04-000-s00-06.png	no family allowances .
h04-000-s01-00.png	The rise in net family
h04-000-s01-01.png	incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-
h04-000-s01-02.png	est for childless couples , especially older
h04-000-s01-03.png	couples ( probably because of the
h04-007-s00-00.png	Compared with 1958 , the expenditure index for 1959
h04-007-s00-01.png	showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without
h04-007-s00-02.png	children and those with one child , and much smaller
h04-007-s00-03.png	changes for couples with several children .
h04-007-s01-00.png	The quantity
h04-007-s01-01.png	index , which has risen only slowly since 1956 , was
h04-007-s01-02.png	almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more
h04-007-s01-03.png	children , but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult
h04-007-s01-04.png	households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless
h04-007-s01-05.png	couples and couples with one child .
h04-021-s00-00.png	As in 1958 , younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent
h04-021-s00-01.png	more per calorie than the national average , and families
h04-021-s00-02.png	with four or more children 19 per cent less .
h04-021-s01-00.png	The only
h04-021-s01-01.png	substantial change was in families with three children ,
h04-021-s01-02.png	for whom the index declined from 91 to 88 .
h04-021-s02-00.png	Table 27
h04-021-s02-01.png	also shows the corresponding values of an index which
h04-021-s02-02.png	compares the prices paid by different types of household
h04-021-s02-03.png	for the commodities constituting the average household
h04-021-s02-04.png	diet in 1959 .
h04-025-s00-00.png	For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the national average
h04-025-s00-01.png	in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below in families with
h04-025-s00-02.png	four or more children , compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per cent in 1958
h04-025-s00-03.png	and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957 .
h04-025-s01-00.png	As with the price of energy index ,
h04-025-s01-01.png	the only noteworthy change was for households with three children ,
h04-025-s01-02.png	in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for
h04-025-s01-03.png	all households in the sample .
h04-028-s00-00.png	The price ranges for milk ,
h04-028-s00-01.png	cheese , sugar , bread and flour
h04-028-s00-02.png	were very narrow .
h04-028-s01-00.png	For most other
h04-028-s01-01.png	foods younger childless couples paid
h04-028-s01-02.png	the highest average prices and
h04-028-s01-03.png	large families the lowest , the price
h04-028-s01-04.png	gradients being steepest for
h04-028-s01-05.png	carcase meat ( +7 to -7 per cent ) ,
h04-028-s01-06.png	 other fish ( +8 to -11 ) , other vegetables
h04-028-s01-07.png	( +9 to -9 ) and beverages other than
h04-028-s01-08.png	tea ( +12 to -16 ) .
h04-035-s00-00.png	Consumption by younger childless couples declined
h04-035-s00-01.png	throughout this period , but that of the smaller families was
h04-035-s00-02.png	maintained except for the slight fall in 1959 .
h04-035-s01-00.png	In the largest
h04-035-s01-01.png	families , particularly those containing four or more children ,
h04-035-s01-02.png	there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and
h04-035-s01-03.png	1957 , and thereafter to decline .
h04-035-s02-00.png	Graduated scales of family
h04-035-s02-01.png	allowances were introduced in October 1956 , and the welfare
h04-035-s02-02.png	milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957 .
h04-049-s00-00.png	75 . The smaller families and the residual groups of
h04-049-s00-01.png	households containing children reduced their consumption
h04-049-s00-02.png	of sugar and of preserves , but in all other types of
h04-049-s00-03.png	household a decline in purchases of the one was
h04-049-s00-04.png	accompanied by an increase in consumption of the other .
h04-049-s01-00.png	76 . Most groups spent slightly less on potatoes than in
h04-049-s01-01.png	the previous year , but consumption was maintained
h04-049-s01-02.png	except in families with more than one child and in
h04-049-s01-03.png	the unclassified households with children or
h04-049-s01-04.png	adolescents .
h04-052-s00-00.png	All groups except families with four or more children
h04-052-s00-01.png	or with adolescents but no children consumed more fresh green
h04-052-s00-02.png	vegetables , especially in the first half of the year , although most
h04-052-s00-03.png	reduced their consumption of other vegetables .
h04-052-s01-00.png	Purchases of
h04-052-s01-01.png	quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased , but extreme-
h04-052-s01-02.png	ly wide group differences persisted , the averages ranging from
h04-052-s01-03.png	0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more
h04-052-s01-04.png	children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult
h04-052-s01-05.png	households ; average consumption by older couples and other
h04-052-s01-06.png	wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week .
h04-055-s00-00.png	The two latter groups consumed much smaller
h04-055-s00-01.png	quantities per head of canned vegetables and canned and
h04-055-s00-02.png	bottled tomatoes than any other group , and much smaller
h04-055-s00-03.png	quantities of canned and bottled fruit than younger
h04-055-s00-04.png	childless couples ; in households containing children ,
h04-055-s00-05.png	consumption of canned fruit fell off sharply with
h04-055-s00-06.png	increasing family size , but there was no regular
h04-055-s00-07.png	gradation in purchases of canned vegetables and canned
h04-055-s00-08.png	tomatoes .
h04-057-s00-00.png	All types of household benefited from the improved
h04-057-s00-01.png	supplies and lower prices of fresh fruit compared
h04-057-s00-02.png	with 1958 , but the increase in consumption was
h04-057-s00-03.png	least in families containing children .
h04-057-s01-00.png	77 . Total
h04-057-s01-01.png	bread consumption was virtually unchanged ,
h04-057-s01-02.png	although most types of household bought less
h04-057-s01-03.png	white bread and more rolls and speciality
h04-057-s01-04.png	breads than in 1958 .
h04-057-s02-00.png	Most groups increased
h04-057-s02-01.png	their purchases of puddings , cakes and biscuits ,
h04-057-s02-02.png	but obtained less flour .
h04-061-s00-00.png	78 . Regression estimates of the expenditure on
h04-061-s00-01.png	different commodities attributable to the adult
h04-061-s00-02.png	couple and each additional child in a selected
h04-061-s00-03.png	group of households consisting of childless couples
h04-061-s00-04.png	( both under 55 ) and couples with different numbers
h04-061-s00-05.png	of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of
h04-061-s00-06.png	the Annual Report for 1956 .
h04-061-s01-00.png	The younger childless
h04-061-s01-01.png	couples are broadly comparable in age and family
h04-061-s01-02.png	income with the family households , so that differences
h04-061-s01-03.png	in food expenditure may be associated with the
h04-061-s01-04.png	presence of children .
h04-071-s00-00.png	The relative expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956 ,
h04-071-s00-01.png	but rose in 1957 when the subsidy on welfare and national dried
h04-071-s00-02.png	milk was reduced ; since 1957 it has again declined .
h04-071-s01-00.png	Most of the
h04-071-s01-01.png	average expenditure associated with a child was on cereal foods ,
h04-071-s01-02.png	potatoes and milk ; for fresh green vegetables , fruit , cheese , fish and
h04-071-s01-03.png	carcase meat , the incremental expenditure was slight .
h04-074-s00-00.png	79 . Table 30 shows the energy value and nutrient content of
h04-074-s00-01.png	the diets of households of different composition .
h04-074-s01-00.png	The averages
h04-074-s01-01.png	showed little change compared with those for the previous year ,
h04-074-s01-02.png	except for generally increased intakes of vitamins C and D .
h04-074-s02-00.png	Since physiological requirements vary widely with age , sex
h04-074-s02-01.png	and level of activity , comparisons between families of different
h04-074-s02-02.png	composition are only apposite when considered in relation
h04-074-s02-03.png	to needs .
h04-078-s00-00.png	80 . Estimates of the adequacy of the diets , assessed by
h04-078-s00-01.png	comparison with allowances based on the recommendations
h04-078-s00-02.png	of the British Medical Association , are also shown in Table 30 .
h04-078-s01-00.png	In comparison with the previous year , changes were small
h04-078-s01-01.png	except for higher estimates for vitamin C .
h04-078-s02-00.png	In families with
h04-078-s02-01.png	four or more children the levels of adequacy for all
h04-078-s02-02.png	nutrients other than vitamin C decreased slightly .
h04-082-s00-00.png	For this fairly small group , comparisons between different
h04-082-s00-01.png	years cannot be made so precisely as in groups with a
h04-082-s00-02.png	defined number of children .
h04-082-s01-00.png	In 1959 the households in
h04-082-s01-01.png	this group contained slightly more children ( average 4.64 )
h04-082-s01-02.png	than in the previous year ( average 4.53 ) .
h04-082-s02-00.png	Their total food
h04-082-s02-01.png	expenditure increased less than that in other groups ,
h04-082-s02-02.png	and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish ,
h04-082-s02-03.png	poultry , eggs , canned vegetables , fresh fruit , chocolate
h04-082-s02-04.png	biscuits and breakfast cereals which , in general , are more
h04-082-s02-05.png	expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which
h04-082-s02-06.png	they purchased less , namely dried milk , potatoes , carcase
h04-082-s02-07.png	meat , sugar , bread , flour and oatmeal and oat products .
h05-012-s00-00.png	5 . Other forms of war damage payment made by the Commission
h05-012-s00-01.png	are highway payments , clearance payments ( for clearing remains of
h05-012-s00-02.png	structures from total loss sites ) and church payments .
h05-012-s01-00.png	Although
h05-012-s01-01.png	differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of
h05-012-s01-02.png	works payments , the sums paid under these heads have the
h05-012-s01-03.png	common feature that they are all payments in respect of works
h05-012-s01-04.png	which have been carried out .
h06-000-s00-00.png	To provide fuller information about certain types of
h06-000-s00-01.png	dangerous occurrence , Section 65 of the Factories Act ,
h06-000-s00-02.png	1937 , requires notification of certain specified
h06-000-s00-03.png	occurrences to H.M. District Inspectors of Factories ,
h06-000-s00-04.png	whether or not they result in injury .
h06-000-s01-00.png	Appendix 20
h06-000-s01-01.png	gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in
h06-000-s01-02.png	1960 ; the types of occurrence which have to be
h06-000-s01-03.png	reported are set out in the heading to the Appendix .
h06-003-s00-00.png	The total number of dangerous occurrences reported
h06-003-s00-01.png	during the year was 1,409 , an increase of 111 over
h06-003-s00-02.png	the total for 1959 .
h06-003-s01-00.png	However , the number of
h06-003-s01-01.png	notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell
h06-003-s01-02.png	from 252 ( 31 of them fatal ) in 1959 to
h06-003-s01-03.png	245 ( 22 fatal ) in 1960 .
h06-003-s02-00.png	The main increase in
h06-003-s02-01.png	the numbers of occurrences reported occurred in the
h06-003-s02-02.png	category of those due to the collapse or
h06-003-s02-03.png	failure of a crane , derrick , winch or hoist , where
h06-003-s02-04.png	there was an increase of almost one-third from
h06-003-s02-05.png	335 to 438 .
h06-079-s00-00.png	The equipment takes two forms - an insulating
h06-079-s00-01.png	guard on the jib of the crane , intended to
h06-079-s00-02.png	prevent direct contact with the line , and
h06-079-s00-03.png	electronic equipment with a sensitive probe
h06-079-s00-04.png	mounted slightly forward of the head of the
h06-079-s00-05.png	jib and with electronic assembly
h06-079-s00-06.png	and warning apparatus in the driver's
h06-079-s00-07.png	cab .
h06-079-s01-00.png	Improved designs of both forms
h06-079-s01-01.png	are being tried out at present .
h06-082-s00-00.png	There is , however , a danger that workers
h06-082-s00-01.png	will rely too much on fixed devices because
h06-082-s00-02.png	they fail to recognise their limitations .
h06-082-s01-00.png	It is therefore safer both in principle and
h06-082-s01-01.png	practice to keep the worker away from
h06-082-s01-02.png	overhead lines wherever possible , e.g. , by
h06-082-s01-03.png	( 1 ) re-routing the line , ( 2 ) putting the supply
h06-082-s01-04.png	underground , ( 3 ) making the line
h06-082-s01-05.png	dead ( after consultation with the supply
h06-082-s01-06.png	authority ) , ( 4 ) providing barriers at a safe
h06-082-s01-07.png	distance to prevent vehicles from approaching
h06-085-s00-00.png	It is also important to remember that on
h06-085-s00-01.png	lines carrying the higher voltages flashover
h06-085-s00-02.png	from the line may take place without
h06-085-s00-03.png	actual contact .
h06-085-s01-00.png	A new type of
h06-085-s01-01.png	machine has recently been developed for
h06-085-s01-02.png	the automatic rolling of sole leather
h06-085-s01-03.png	bends .
h06-085-s02-00.png	The sheet of leather is placed
h06-085-s02-01.png	on a sliding feed tray outside the
h06-085-s02-02.png	danger zone and is then pushed
h06-085-s02-03.png	forward between two platens , the upper
h06-085-s02-04.png	one carrying a set of small rollers .
h06-089-s00-00.png	The lower platen , which supports the
h06-089-s00-01.png	leather , is raised hydraulically to bring
h06-089-s00-02.png	it into contact with the rollers on the upper
h06-089-s00-03.png	platen , which is then caused to make
h06-089-s00-04.png	several horizontal oscillations so that the
h06-089-s00-05.png	leather is rolled and pressed at the same time .
h06-089-s01-00.png	The danger zone between the platens is fenced
h06-089-s01-01.png	by a guard which is interlocked with the
h06-089-s01-02.png	hydraulic valve and the press is also
h06-089-s01-03.png	sequentially operated : the closing of the shutter
h06-089-s01-04.png	starts the machine , the rest of the cycle
h06-089-s01-05.png	following automatically .
h06-092-s00-00.png	A new method of applying sand to the
h06-092-s00-01.png	faces of green bricks has recently been
h06-092-s00-02.png	developed .
h06-092-s01-00.png	In the case of wire-cut bricks
h06-092-s01-01.png	the column of clay from the pug-mill is
h06-092-s01-02.png	carried by a short length of belt
h06-092-s01-03.png	conveyor to the sanding plant .
h06-092-s02-00.png	This consists basically of a vibrating
h06-092-s02-01.png	hopper from which the sand is
h06-092-s02-02.png	distributed to all four faces by a
h06-092-s02-03.png	system of slots , scrapers and worms .
h06-096-s00-00.png	The conveyor is broken at this point to
h06-096-s00-01.png	enable the sand to be applied to
h06-096-s00-02.png	the under surface of the column , which
h06-096-s00-03.png	passes on through two pairs of
h06-096-s00-04.png	vibrating rollers which embed the sand
h06-096-s00-05.png	firmly in the surfaces and is finally
h06-096-s00-06.png	cut into bricks at the wire cutting
h06-096-s00-07.png	table .
h07-000-s00-00.png	Of over 7,000,000 square feet of factory space built by the
h07-000-s00-01.png	development corporations , about 20 per cent represents
h07-000-s00-02.png	extensions built after the firms had become established .
h07-000-s01-00.png	It is the policy of the corporations to charge full rack-
h07-000-s01-01.png	rents or ground rents for their factories or industrial
h07-000-s01-02.png	sites ; and rents vary considerably according to the demand
h07-000-s01-03.png	for factory accommodation .
h07-003-s00-00.png	The average gross return on established industrial estates
h07-003-s00-01.png	ranges from 7 to 9 per cent of the capital expenditure on land ,
h07-003-s00-02.png	site works and buildings .
h07-003-s01-00.png	Manufacturing industry affords
h07-003-s01-01.png	employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as
h07-003-s01-02.png	manual workers .
h07-003-s02-00.png	An analysis made by Crawley Development
h07-003-s02-01.png	Corporation in 1958 , after collating replies from fifty-eight
h07-003-s02-02.png	manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff ,
h07-003-s02-03.png	showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as
h07-003-s02-04.png	managerial and administrative , 11 per cent as technical
h07-003-s02-05.png	or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical .
h07-007-s00-00.png	There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to
h07-007-s00-01.png	Crawley .
h07-007-s01-00.png	The development corporations have aimed at a varied
h07-007-s01-01.png	pattern of industry , offering a reasonable choice of
h07-007-s01-02.png	employer as well as choice of occupation for men , women and
h07-007-s01-03.png	school-leavers , with due regard to the industries
h07-007-s01-04.png	already established in their towns .
h07-007-s02-00.png	Inevitably engineering ,
h07-007-s02-01.png	including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries ,
h07-007-s02-02.png	predominates in all the London new towns since these are
h07-007-s02-03.png	among the industries which have expanded most
h07-007-s02-04.png	during the last ten years in the country generally .
h07-011-s00-00.png	Of those at present employed in manufacturing industry
h07-011-s00-01.png	in the eight London new towns about 40 per cent are
h07-011-s00-02.png	employed in engineering and electrical goods manufacture -
h07-011-s00-03.png	the proportion employed in both these groups combined
h07-011-s00-04.png	varies from about 30 per cent in Welwyn to 85 per cent in
h07-011-s00-05.png	Stevenage and 90 per cent in Hatfield .
h07-013-s00-00.png	These figures are much higher than the national
h07-013-s00-01.png	averages , and may be thought to indicate a
h07-013-s00-02.png	lack of balance in some of the towns .
h07-013-s01-00.png	On the other
h07-013-s01-01.png	hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of
h07-013-s01-02.png	skilled employment and are highly diversified
h07-013-s01-03.png	as regards products , markets and methods of
h07-013-s01-04.png	manufacture .
h07-013-s02-00.png	Consumer goods industries such as the
h07-013-s02-01.png	manufacture of food # and drink , tobacco , clothing
h07-013-s02-02.png	and footwear are under-represented in the new
h07-013-s02-03.png	towns generally though not in Basildon and
h07-013-s02-04.png	Welwyn .
h07-017-s00-00.png	The following table indicates the size of the
h07-017-s00-01.png	firms , some of them occupying more than
h07-017-s00-02.png	one factory , introduced or sponsored by
h07-017-s00-03.png	development corporations in the new towns :
h07-017-s01-00.png	The
h07-017-s01-01.png	overall average for the factories sponsored by
h07-017-s01-02.png	development corporations is about 170 employees
h07-017-s01-03.png	per firm , and the average for each of the London
h07-017-s01-04.png	new towns is roughly the same except at Hatfield ,
h07-017-s01-05.png	where it is much lower , and Stevenage , where it
h07-017-s01-06.png	is much higher .
h07-020-s00-00.png	The position at Stevenage is accounted for by
h07-020-s00-01.png	the presence of one firm with 3,700 employees
h07-020-s00-02.png	and two others with over 1,000 employees .
h07-020-s01-00.png	About 32 per cent of all the workers employed
h07-020-s01-01.png	in factories sponsored by the development
h07-020-s01-02.png	corporations are employed by the eleven
h07-020-s01-03.png	largest firms and about 23 per cent by the next
h07-020-s01-04.png	group of firms employing between five
h07-020-s01-05.png	hundred and one thousand workers .
h07-023-s00-00.png	In factories sponsored by the London new town
h07-023-s00-01.png	development corporations the proportion of
h07-023-s00-02.png	female employees , expressed as a percentage
h07-023-s00-03.png	of all employees , varies from 23 per cent in
h07-023-s00-04.png	Welwyn Garden City and 24 per cent in
h07-023-s00-05.png	Hemel Hempstead to 35 per cent in
h07-023-s00-06.png	Basildon and 55 per cent in Hatfield
h07-023-s00-07.png	with an average of about 30 per cent
h07-023-s00-08.png	- rather less than in the country as a whole .
h07-025-s00-00.png	The figures for Corby and Peterlee
h07-025-s00-01.png	( where the prime need so far has
h07-025-s00-02.png	been to provide employment for
h07-025-s00-03.png	women and girls ) are 82 per cent
h07-025-s00-04.png	and 74 per cent respectively .
h07-025-s01-00.png	Shopping provision in the new towns
h07-025-s01-01.png	has generally been based on an
h07-025-s01-02.png	estimated need of about eight
h07-025-s01-03.png	shops for every thousand people ,
h07-025-s01-04.png	this being considered sufficient
h07-025-s01-05.png	to allow for shoppers coming
h07-025a-s00-00.png	The figures for Corby and Peterlee ( where the
h07-025a-s00-01.png	prime need so far has been to provide employment

h07-028-s00-00.png	Distribution over the town as
h07-028-s00-01.png	a whole varies , the smaller
h07-028-s00-02.png	towns tending to rely mainly
h07-028-s00-03.png	on the town centres with a
h07-028-s00-04.png	few pantry shops in the
h07-028-s00-05.png	neighbourhoods and the larger
h07-028-s00-06.png	ones providing neighbourhood
h07-028-s00-07.png	centres of up to thirty or more
h07-028-s00-08.png	shops at the heart of the
h07-028-s00-09.png	residential areas , as well as

h07-030-s00-00.png	Some development corporations
h07-030-s00-01.png	have sought to attract private
h07-030-s00-02.png	investors by leasing part of the

h07-030a-s01-01.png	more satisfactory to build themselves , leasing the
h07-030a-s01-02.png	shops to traders , with breaks in the lease to
h07-030a-s01-03.png	enable rents to be increased in scale with
h07-030a-s01-04.png	the rising prosperity of the town .
h07-033-s00-00.png	This control over lettings also
h07-033-s00-01.png	secures a balanced distribution

h07-054a-s00-00.png	Except at Hemel Hempstead , large office
h07-054a-s00-01.png	organisations have until quite recently shown
h07-054a-s00-02.png	little interest in the new towns , probably because of
h07-054a-s00-03.png	the difficulty in the early years in recruiting
h07-054a-s00-04.png	suitable staff , especially junior staff , locally .
h07-054a-s01-00.png	There is evidence of greater interest today ,
h07-054a-s01-01.png	with nearly half a million square feet of
h07-054a-s01-02.png	office space under construction - almost as
h07-054a-s01-03.png	much as the total area so far completed .
h07-057a-s00-00.png	This interest is likely to grow as employers become
h07-057a-s00-01.png	aware of the advantages of setting up offices in towns

h07-080-s00-00.png	It is believed that about 60 per cent of the

h07-084-s01-01.png	houses let by the development # corporations in the
h07-084-s01-02.png	London new towns have gone to Londoners , about
h07-084-s01-03.png	half of whom are known to have been on local
h07-084-s01-04.png	authority housing lists .
h07-087-s00-00.png	Tables C , D and E of Appendix 16 give details of
h07-087-s00-01.png	factories , shops and offices completed and under

j01-042-s00-00.png	Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given
j01-042-s00-01.png	material in the sodium coolant circuit will start to
j01-042-s00-02.png	oxidise the cell can only be used as has been
j01-042-s00-03.png	suggested above , as an oxygen concentration monitor .
j01-042-s01-00.png	However , if a material oxidizes in sodium at a given
j01-042-s01-01.png	oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held
j01-042-s01-02.png	at that potential and oxidizing or reducing conditions
j01-042-s01-03.png	in the coolant circuit for that material would be
j01-042-s01-04.png	indicated by a negative or positive potential at the
j01-042-s01-05.png	reference electrode .
j01-045-s00-00.png	Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium
j01-045-s00-01.png	circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference
j01-045-s00-02.png	electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated
j01-045-s00-03.png	with niobium separated from the coolant by a
j01-045-s00-04.png	solid anionic electrolyte .
j01-045-s01-00.png	A negative voltage from
j01-045-s01-01.png	the reference electrode would mean oxidizing
j01-045-s01-02.png	conditions for niobium and positive voltage , non-
j01-045-s01-03.png	oxidizing conditions .
j01-045-s02-00.png	The practical application of
j01-045-s02-01.png	the above idea will involve considerable experimenta-
j01-045-s02-02.png	tion before it can be realised .
j01-049-s00-00.png	The first requirement is for an anionic
j01-049-s00-01.png	electrolyte , which can be fabricated into
j01-049-s00-02.png	suitable shapes impervious to gases and
j01-049-s00-03.png	liquid sodium and which is neither
j01-049-s00-04.png	corroded by sodium nor by sodium
j01-049-s00-05.png	monoxide .
j01-049-s01-00.png	Possible materials are zirconia
j01-049-s01-01.png	stabilised with lime and thoria doped
j01-049-s01-02.png	with rare earth oxides .
j01-059-s00-00.png	Provided the temperatures at C and E are
j01-059-s00-01.png	the same , thermoelectric contributions to the
j01-059-s00-02.png	voltage should be zero .
j01-059-s01-00.png	The probe extends
j01-059-s01-01.png	out of the sodium stream through a close
j01-059-s01-02.png	fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes
j01-059-s01-03.png	into the open via a water-cooled O ring seal G .
j01-059-s02-00.png	The open end of the probe is sealed with
j01-059-s02-01.png	a vacuum coupling H which also positions
j01-059-s02-02.png	the +ve nickel conductor with respect
j01-059-s02-03.png	to the sodium by circlips on either side
j01-059-s02-04.png	of the seal I .
j01-063-s00-00.png	Evaporation of sodium from the pool C is
j01-063-s00-01.png	minimised by a close fitting cylindrical
j01-063-s00-02.png	block of electrolyte J attached to the +ve nickel
j01-063-s00-03.png	conductor by nickel circlips .
j01-063-s01-00.png	Fixing and
j01-063-s01-01.png	positioning of the probe relative to the coolant
j01-063-s01-02.png	stream is effected by tie-bars of insulating
j01-063-s01-03.png	material K joining the vacuum coupling H to the
j01-063-s01-04.png	water cooled flange G .
j01-066-s00-00.png	The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas
j01-066-s00-01.png	via the tube L which must of course be electrically
j01-066-s00-02.png	isolated after this has been carried out .
j01-066-s01-00.png	It is not
j01-066-s01-01.png	suggested that the above proposal will be successful
j01-066-s01-02.png	but rather that it is worth a trial in the event of
j01-066-s01-03.png	the inadequacy of some simpler method of
j01-066-s01-04.png	monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit .
j01-066-s02-00.png	The
j01-066-s02-01.png	principal difficulty encountered by the author , in
j01-066-s02-02.png	determining partial molal free energies by solid
j01-066-s02-03.png	electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2 ,
j01-066-s02-04.png	MnO etc. was vapour phase transfer of oxygen by
j01-066-s02-05.png	carbonaceous impurities in the blanket gas .
j01-070-s00-00.png	This resulted in the oxidation of the
j01-070-s00-01.png	-ve electrode and reduction of the +ve
j01-070-s00-02.png	electrode which of course led to a loss in
j01-070-s00-03.png	E.M.F. from the cell .
j01-070-s01-00.png	In the above design the two
j01-070-s01-01.png	electrodes are completely separated from one
j01-070-s01-02.png	another so that this major source of
j01-070-s01-03.png	trouble should not be present .
j04-008-s00-00.png	The presence of 75 of bismuth-210 is equivalent to
j04-008-s00-01.png	ingrowth over two half-lives ( ten days ) .
j04-008-s01-00.png	Therefore
j04-008-s01-01.png	after a further forty days , the bismuth daughter
j04-008-s01-02.png	will be within 0.1
j04-008-s02-00.png	sources are required for use sooner
j04-008-s02-01.png	than forty or fifty days after preparation , the
j04-008-s02-02.png	lead-210 together with added lead carrier must
j04-008-s02-03.png	be separated from the bismuth-210 daughter by
j04-008-s02-04.png	ion exchange ( see Analytical Method , steps 4 , 5 )
j04-008-s02-05.png	before precipitating lead chromate .
j04-012-s00-00.png	Knowing the time of separation and the
j04-012-s00-01.png	activity of the lead-210 solution , the ingrowth
j04-012-s00-02.png	of the bismuth-210 can be calculated .
j04-012-s01-00.png	The
j04-012-s01-01.png	absolute activity of the reference standards
j04-012-s01-02.png	can be calculated from the known activity
j04-012-s01-03.png	of the lead-210 solution and the chemical
j04-012-s01-04.png	yield , but this calculation is unnecessary
j04-012-s01-05.png	provided the same lead carrier solution is
j04-012-s01-06.png	used to prepare the reference standards
j04-012-s01-07.png	and for the analyses .
j04-015-s00-00.png	Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate
j04-015-s00-01.png	precipitates need be known because the concentration
j04-015-s00-02.png	of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the
j04-015-s00-03.png	algebraic equations .
j04-015-s01-00.png	An effort was made to
j04-015-s01-01.png	detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in
j04-015-s01-02.png	the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the
j04-015-s01-03.png	bismuth-210 by anion exchange .
j04-015-s02-00.png	The 15b-counting
j04-015-s02-01.png	of the lead-210 fraction began within a few
j04-015-s02-02.png	minutes of completing the separation .
j04-019-s00-00.png	The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed
j04-019-s00-01.png	for ten days and showed no abnormalities .
j04-019-s01-00.png	Any impurity in the lead fraction must ha-
j04-019-s01-01.png	ve been well below one percent .
j04-019-s02-00.png	Some separa-
j04-019-s02-01.png	ted lead-210 was used to make reference stan-
j04-019-s02-02.png	dards and as a tracer in recovery experiments .
j04-019-s03-00.png	There was no significant difference between the-
j04-019-s03-01.png	se results and those obtained using the original
j04-019-s03-02.png	lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical
j04-019-s03-03.png	Centre which we concluded was radiochemi-
j04-019-s03-04.png	cally pure .
j04-024-s00-00.png	Rosenquist ( 4 ) showed that minute quantities of
j04-024-s00-01.png	lead can be isolated from large volumes of solu-
j04-024-s00-02.png	tion by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium
j04-024-s00-03.png	sulphate .
j04-024-s01-00.png	Lead and strontium form mixed cry-
j04-024-s01-01.png	stals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate
j04-024-s01-02.png	is almost completely recovered even if precipitation
j04-024-s01-03.png	of the strontium sulphate is incomplete .
j04-024-s02-00.png	Using
j04-024-s02-01.png	ten milligrams of lead carrier and six
j04-024-s02-02.png	hundred milligrams of strontium per liter ,
j04-024-s02-03.png	more than 95 experiment .
j04-035-s00-00.png	Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a
j04-035-s00-01.png	minimum but the accuracy and precision of
j04-035-s00-02.png	weighing the precipitated sources suffers .
j04-035-s01-00.png	All
j04-035-s01-01.png	precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance
j04-035-s01-02.png	which had been calibrated with a set of certificated
j04-035-s01-03.png	weights from the National Physical Laboratory .
j04-035-s02-00.png	Complete chemical exchange between the
j04-035-s02-01.png	radio-lead and the added lead carrier is
j04-035-s02-02.png	necessary if the analytical results are to
j04-035-s02-03.png	be correct .
j04-039-s00-00.png	In the preliminary experiments , the tracer was added to a
j04-039-s00-01.png	liter of effluent and immediately coprecipitated with
j04-039-s00-02.png	strontium sulphate from hot solution .
j04-039-s01-00.png	Chemical exchange
j04-039-s01-01.png	was complete under these conditions ; but when the tracer
j04-039-s01-02.png	was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to
j04-039-s01-03.png	stand for several days before the addition of lead
j04-039-s01-04.png	carrier , the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five
j04-039-s01-05.png	per cent low when corrected for gravimetric recovery
j04-039-s01-06.png	of the carrier .
j04-046-s00-00.png	The presence and growth of algae in the
j04-046-s00-01.png	alkaline effluent does not prevent the
j04-046-s00-02.png	recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed
j04-046-s00-03.png	conditions although some radioactivity remains
j04-046-s00-04.png	on the algae until the metathesis has been
j04-046-s00-05.png	completed by heating the mixed sulphates
j04-046-s00-06.png	with three separate portions of dilute ( 1.25
j04-046-s00-07.png	normal ) sodium carbonate solution .
j04-046-s01-00.png	The
j04-046-s01-01.png	strength of the carbonate solution was
j04-046-s01-02.png	chosen after experiments with lead tracer
j04-046-s01-03.png	alone which indicated that less lead was
j04-053-s00-00.png	A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin
j04-053-s00-01.png	cannot be ground with a mortar and pestle .
j04-053-s01-00.png	The
j04-053-s01-01.png	sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water
j04-053-s01-02.png	to remove fines and then with hydrochloric acid to
j04-053-s01-03.png	convert the resin completely to the chloride form .
j04-053-s02-00.png	The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to
j04-053-s02-01.png	remove the acid and finally dried in air .
j04-061-s00-00.png	The glass tube is 11 cm. long and 1 cm. in internal
j04-061-s00-01.png	diameter .
j04-061-s01-00.png	One end of the tube is drawn down to a fine
j04-061-s01-01.png	tip and a B14 conical glass socket is fitted to the
j04-061-s01-02.png	other end as shown in Figure 1 .
j04-061-s02-00.png	The reservoir is a 50 ml
j04-061-s02-01.png	cylindrical separating funnel with a capillary tap
j04-061-s02-02.png	modified by the addition of a B14 cone to fit the
j04-061-s02-03.png	glass column .
j04-065-s00-00.png	The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by
j04-065-s00-01.png	experiment for each batch of resin using radioactive tracer
j04-065-s00-02.png	( lead-210 , bismuth-210 ) .
j04-065-s01-00.png	A typical elution curve is shown in
j04-065-s01-01.png	Figure 3 .
j04-065-s02-00.png	Once these volumes have been established , the weight
j04-065-s02-01.png	of resin used is also fixed .
j04-065-s03-00.png	All available evidence indicates
j04-065-s03-01.png	that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free
j04-065-s03-02.png	of cross contamination apart from the natural
j04-065-s03-03.png	ingrowth of the daughters arising from the decay of
j04-065-s03-04.png	lead .
j04-070-s00-00.png	Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not
j04-070-s00-01.png	interfere .
j04-070-s01-00.png	Strontium does not form a chloro-complex
j04-070-s01-01.png	and therefore passes through in the feed solution and
j04-070-s01-02.png	the first wash .
j04-070-s02-00.png	The resin is used for a single
j04-070-s02-01.png	separation and then thrown away .
j04-070-s03-00.png	In the first stage
j04-070-s03-01.png	of the analysis , only the fraction containing
j04-070-s03-02.png	lead-210 is collected .
j04-070-s04-00.png	The lead is precipitated as
j04-070-s04-01.png	the chromate , washed , slurried onto an aluminium
j04-070-s04-02.png	counting tray , dried under an infra-red lamp ,
j04-070-s04-03.png	weighed , and set aside for five days while the
j04-070-s04-04.png	bismuth-210 grows in .
j04-076-s00-00.png	At the end of five days , bismuth-210 will have
j04-076-s00-01.png	reached one-half of its equilibrium value and
j04-076-s00-02.png	can be counted through an aluminium absorber
j04-076-s00-03.png	sufficiently thick to stop the beta particles
j04-076-s00-04.png	from lead-210 and the alpha particles from
j04-076-s00-05.png	polonium-210 .
j04-080-s00-00.png	During the first few hours the curve will be
j04-080-s00-01.png	distorted if activity other than bismuth-
j04-080-s00-02.png	210 is present .
j04-080-s01-00.png	These bismuth nuclides may
j04-080-s01-01.png	include : together with their lead parents .
j04-080-s02-00.png	All but lead-212 will decay completely
j04-080-s02-01.png	within six hours .
j04-080-s03-00.png	The decay of lead-212
j04-080-s03-01.png	will distort the observed activity for
j04-080-s03-02.png	hour and a half days if it is
j04-080-s03-03.png	present .
j04-094-s00-00.png	If there is sufficient beta activity , the radioche-
j04-094-s00-01.png	mical purity of the Bi-210 may be checked
j04-094-s00-02.png	by observing the decay curve .
j04-094-s01-00.png	The removal of lead
j04-094-s01-01.png	chromate from the aluminium counting tray together
j04-094-s01-02.png	with the bismuth-210 prior to the second ion
j04-094-s01-03.png	exchange separation has been checked by
j04-094-s01-04.png	counting the trays .
j04-094-s02-00.png	Not more than 0.2 of the
j04-094-s02-01.png	bismuth-210 remains on the tray after the
j04-094-s02-02.png	acid wash .
j04-098-s00-00.png	This loss is acceptably small for an analytical
j04-098-s00-01.png	step when no correction for carrier
j04-098-s00-02.png	recovery is possible .
j04-098-s01-00.png	The completeness
j04-098-s01-01.png	of the chemical exchange between the
j04-098-s01-02.png	bismuth-210 and the added carrier was
j04-098-s01-03.png	also tested .
j04-098-s02-00.png	Two samples of precipitated
j04-098-s02-01.png	lead chromate ( lead-210 , bismuth-210 )
j04-098-s02-02.png	were counted and dissolved in nitric
j04-098-s02-03.png	acid in silica basins .
j04-098-s03-00.png	The contents
j04-098-s03-01.png	were evaporated to dryness with
j04-098-s03-02.png	bismuth carrier and then taken up in
j04-103-s00-00.png	The bismuth was recovered from the eluate as the
j04-103-s00-01.png	phosphate .
j04-103-s01-00.png	Results did not differ from those obtained by the more
j04-103-s01-01.png	convenient method of heating the dissolved chro-
j04-103-s01-02.png	mates in 2 N hydrochloric acid for fifteen minutes .
j04-103-s02-00.png	The more
j04-103-s02-01.png	rigorous method of securing chemical exchange was unnecessary .
j04-103-s03-00.png	Lead-210 when present in effluent is likely to be found
j04-103-s03-01.png	only at very low concentrations .
j04-111-s00-00.png	Table 1 shows the decontamination factors
j04-111-s00-01.png	obtained experimentally for ten radionuclides ,
j04-111-s00-02.png	accompanied in two instances by radioactive dau-
j04-111-s00-03.png	ghters .
j04-111-s01-00.png	The decontamination factor falls below
j04-111-s01-01.png	104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95
j04-111-s01-02.png	with their daughters in the first stage , i.e.
j04-111-s01-03.png	the lead chromate source containing the bismuth-
j04-111-s01-04.png	21 daughter .
j04-111-s02-00.png	When the second stage ( the bismuth
j04-111-s02-01.png	phosphate source ) is completed , the decontami-
j04-111-s02-02.png	nation factors are exceptionally high .
j04-115-s00-00.png	A known quantity ( approx. 1 x 10-2 15mc ) of
j04-115-s00-01.png	lead-210 was added to 1-litre aliquots
j04-115-s00-02.png	of different batches of typical low-activity
j04-115-s00-03.png	effluent .
j04-115-s01-00.png	The aliquots were allowed to
j04-115-s01-01.png	stand for about seven days ( except
j04-115-s01-02.png	where noted to the contrary ) before lead
j04-115-s01-03.png	carrier was added and the analytical
j04-115-s01-04.png	procedure begun .
j06-000-s00-00.png	All stages of Calanus , for example ,
j06-000-s00-01.png	seem to migrate on some occasions while
j06-000-s00-02.png	any stage may not on others .
j06-000-s01-00.png	Such data
j06-000-s01-01.png	cannot yet be rationalized .
j06-000-s02-00.png	Where
j06-000-s02-01.png	information is less extensive , however , it is
j06-000-s02-02.png	possible to find some regularity in the
j06-000-s02-03.png	observations .
j06-000-s03-00.png	Thus in Euphausia superba
j06-000-s03-01.png	from the Antarctic , the metanauplii remain
j06-000-s03-02.png	in deep water , the later larval stages
j06-000-s03-03.png	migrate diurnally , and the adolescents
j06-000-s03-04.png	stay permanently at the surface .
j06-005-s00-00.png	The migrating stages all come from 100-250
j06-005-s00-01.png	meters , and the time of their arrival at
j06-005-s00-02.png	the surface is directly related to their
j06-005-s00-03.png	swimming capacity : 3rd ( oldest )
j06-005-s00-04.png	calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr ; 2nd ,
j06-005-s00-05.png	from 2200-0200 hr ; and 1st , from 0200-0600 hr .
j06-005-s01-00.png	Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent
j06-005-s01-01.png	in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain
j06-005-s01-02.png	at the surface while the young migrate
j06-005-s01-03.png	to and from a depth of 50 meters .
j06-008-s00-00.png	Such permanent occurrence at the surface
j06-008-s00-01.png	could of course be considered the extreme
j06-008-s00-02.png	of a variable day depth .
j06-008-s01-00.png	The effect of
j06-008-s01-01.png	day depths upon the surfacing of various
j06-008-s01-02.png	animals has been reviewed elsewhere .
j06-008-s02-00.png	c .
j06-008-s02-01.png	Anomalies .
j06-008-s03-00.png	In spite of the variability
j06-008-s03-01.png	of migrational behavior , some kinds
j06-008-s03-02.png	of anomalies may be recognized .
j06-008-s04-00.png	Vertical movement occurs in some forms
j06-008-s04-01.png	apparently in the reverse manner to
j06-008-s04-02.png	that commonly met .
j06-014-s00-00.png	Such reversed migrations are known for
j06-014-s00-01.png	Acartia clausi , A. longiremis , Nyctiphanes
j06-014-s00-02.png	couchii , Evadne sp. , Oithona nana , Daphnia
j06-014-s00-03.png	lumholzi , Stages 4 , 5 , and adult of
j06-014-s00-04.png	Calanus finmarchicus , Diaptomus banforanus ,
j06-014-s00-05.png	and Cyclops bicuspidatus .
j06-014-s01-00.png	An echo-producing
j06-014-s01-01.png	layer , which the authors think probably consists
j06-014-s01-02.png	of euphausiids , has also been described
j06-014-s01-03.png	as , in part , regularly moving in a reverse
j06-014-s01-04.png	manner .
j06-014-s02-00.png	Most of these records are well
j06-014-s02-01.png	substantiated and involve whole populations
j06-014-s02-02.png	rather than aberrant individuals .
j06-018-s00-00.png	But normal movements have been
j06-018-s00-01.png	reported also for the same species in
j06-018-s00-02.png	the case of five of these examples
j06-018-s00-03.png	and for other species in the same
j06-018-s00-04.png	genera for the remaining Evadne ,
j06-018-s00-05.png	Daphnia , and Diaptomus .
j06-018-s01-00.png	Many
j06-018-s01-01.png	forms sometimes migrate and on other
j06-018-s01-02.png	occasions do not , but a few
j06-018-s01-03.png	appear to remain permanently at
j06-018-s01-04.png	one level .
j06-018-s02-00.png	Considering the widespread
j06-018-s02-01.png	incidence of migration in the
j06-022-s00-00.png	The most clearly substantiated case
j06-022-s00-01.png	is that of the copepod Anomalocera
j06-022-s00-02.png	patersoni , which remains permanently
j06-022-s00-03.png	at the surface .
j06-022-s01-00.png	Among other copepods
j06-022-s01-01.png	Rhincalanus gigas , Calanoides acutus ,
j06-022-s01-02.png	Microcalanus pygmaeus , Oithona
j06-022-s01-03.png	frigida , and Centropages typicus are
j06-022-s01-04.png	reported as showing no migration .
j06-022-s02-00.png	The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes
j06-022-s02-01.png	longimanus also remains at one
j06-022-s02-02.png	level , about 10 meters down .
j06-026-s00-00.png	In view of its well-known normal
j06-026-s00-01.png	migration , the occurrence of Calanus
j06-026-s00-02.png	finmarchicus in the summer at
j06-026-s00-03.png	the surface in bright sunlight
j06-026-s00-04.png	may justly be considered anomalous .
j06-026-s01-00.png	This phenomenon has nevertheless been
j06-026-s01-01.png	recorded many times , and such
j06-026-s01-02.png	surface Calanus may be present in
j06-026-s01-03.png	enormous numbers , breaking the surface
j06-026-s01-04.png	into small circular ripples like
j06-030-s00-00.png	It seems likely that a continuous
j06-030-s00-01.png	interchange was taking place between
j06-030-s00-02.png	the population at the surface and
j06-030-s00-03.png	that in deeper water .
j06-030-s01-00.png	A second
j06-030-s01-01.png	group whose normal vertical
j06-030-s01-02.png	migration is sufficiently well
j06-030-s01-03.png	known to make daytime
j06-030-s01-04.png	occurrence at the surface
j06-030-s01-05.png	rank as anomalous is the
j06-030-s01-06.png	Euphausiacea .
j06-030-s02-00.png	There are numerous
j06-030-s02-01.png	records of euphausiids swimming
j06-034-s00-00.png	2 . Mechanisms .
j06-034-s01-00.png	The majority of
j06-034-s01-01.png	vertical migrations undoubtedly
j06-034-s01-02.png	result from active swimming
j06-034-s01-03.png	although passive movement through
j06-034-s01-04.png	the water has been suggested on
j06-034-s01-05.png	various grounds .
j06-034-s02-00.png	For example ,
j06-034-s02-01.png	transport in vertical currents
j06-034-s02-02.png	resulting from temperature diff-
j06-034-s02-03.png	erences has been proposed ; diff-
j06-034-s02-04.png	erences in water viscosity after
j06-034-s02-05.png	temperature changes have also been
j06-051-s00-00.png	Downward movement may in some forms
j06-051-s00-01.png	start as a passive sinking , especially
j06-051-s00-02.png	when it occurs before dawn ; but this
j06-051-s00-03.png	must almost certainly be replaced
j06-051-s00-04.png	by the headfirst downward swimming
j06-051-s00-05.png	observed in the field .
j06-051-s01-00.png	3 . Initiating ,
j06-051-s01-01.png	controlling , and orienting factors .
j06-051-s02-00.png	The
j06-051-s02-01.png	primary dependence of diurnal
j06-051-s02-02.png	migrations upon changes in light intensity
j06-051-s02-03.png	is beyond doubt .
j06-051-s03-00.png	Yet in spite
j06-051-s03-01.png	of a great amount of work ,
j06-056-s00-00.png	Loeb first suggested the importance
j06-056-s00-01.png	of light as the governing factor
j06-056-s00-02.png	but combined its influence with that
j06-056-s00-03.png	of gravity .
j06-056-s01-00.png	Later authors , in particular
j06-056-s01-01.png	Rose , have proposed that light
j06-056-s01-02.png	alone can provide an adequate
j06-056-s01-03.png	mechanism if the animals have ,
j06-056-s01-04.png	and select by exploration , a
j06-056-s01-05.png	zone of optimum light intensity .
j06-056-s02-00.png	This view has been enlarged
j06-056-s02-01.png	with a suggestion that both
j07-000-s00-00.png	This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be
j07-000-s00-01.png	obtained with tubular constructions .
j07-000-s01-00.png	The growth of the
j07-000-s01-01.png	aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need
j07-000-s01-02.png	for lightweight compact heat exchangers .
j07-000-s02-00.png	During the 1930's ,
j07-000-s02-01.png	the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction
j07-000-s02-02.png	became established for aero-engine radiators , using
j07-000-s02-03.png	dip-soldered copper .
j07-000-s03-00.png	The air and engine-coolant passages
j07-000-s03-01.png	were separated by flat plates .
j07-005-s00-00.png	The air passages were packed with corrugated
j07-005-s00-01.png	foil bonded to the primary plates to
j07-005-s00-02.png	provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer .
j07-005-s01-00.png	The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil ,
j07-005-s01-01.png	chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand
j07-005-s01-02.png	the coolant pressure loadings .
j07-005-s02-00.png	The introduction of the aluminium alloy
j07-005-s02-01.png	dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up
j07-005-s02-02.png	for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial
j07-005-s02-03.png	weight reductions as compared with copper construction .
j07-009-s00-00.png	This development coincided with the introduction of
j07-009-s00-01.png	pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air
j07-009-s00-02.png	cabin coolers .
j07-009-s01-00.png	Although in this case the heat transfer
j07-009-s01-01.png	coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger
j07-009-s01-02.png	were of comparable magnitude , the use of
j07-009-s01-03.png	secondary surface was still attractive , since the
j07-009-s01-04.png	greater part of the surface area could be made up
j07-009-s01-05.png	of fins only 0.006 in. ( 0.15 mm. ) thick .
j07-012-s00-00.png	Furthermore , developments in the detail form of
j07-012-s00-01.png	the fins made possible a reduction in the total
j07-012-s00-02.png	surface area required as compared with the use of
j07-012-s00-03.png	smooth continuous passages for the same thermal
j07-012-s00-04.png	duty and pressure losses .
j07-012-s01-00.png	The properties of
j07-012-s01-01.png	compact form , low weight , and design flexibility
j07-012-s01-02.png	thus developed found ready application on a
j07-012-s01-03.png	much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage
j07-012-s01-04.png	scale air separation plants .
j07-015-s00-00.png	The basic method of construction is both simple and
j07-015-s00-01.png	extremely flexible .
j07-015-s01-00.png	Figure 3 illustrates the
j07-015-s01-01.png	arrangement of a single passage .
j07-015-s02-00.png	This can be
j07-015-s02-01.png	extended in length and width up to the limit of
j07-015-s02-02.png	manufacturing equipment available .
j07-015-s03-00.png	The corrugation
j07-015-s03-01.png	is machine-formed , thus ensuring a high standard
j07-015-s03-02.png	of uniformity in height and fin pitch .
k01-051-s00-00.png	Though that was not quite the phrase , for even
k01-051-s00-01.png	if he could succeed Sir Charles he would , as
k01-051-s00-02.png	an executive , be eternally differentiated from
k01-051-s00-03.png	the Governors .
k01-051-s01-00.png	Fairbanks managed the Governors
k01-051-s01-01.png	beautifully , he knew more than they , he was
k01-051-s01-02.png	cleverer than most , discreetly used their Christian
k01-051-s01-03.png	names - but remained their servant .
k01-051-s02-00.png	They had
k01-051-s02-01.png	no office hours , however elastic ; their lives were
k01-051-s02-02.png	spent in committee making decisions for others
k01-051-s02-03.png	to execute on the basis of data laboriously
k02-018-s00-00.png	The gin pahits , and now the beer with the
k02-018-s00-01.png	curry , had their desired effect on us ;
k02-018-s00-02.png	or rather , on Nigel and myself .
k02-018-s01-00.png	Lee , I
k02-018-s01-01.png	noticed , had asked for Coca-Cola .
k02-018-s02-00.png	This
k02-018-s02-01.png	rather surprised me from a young man
k02-018-s02-02.png	who was otherwise so sophisticated .
k02-018-s03-00.png	He
k02-018-s03-01.png	was not , however , ostentatious about
k02-018-s03-02.png	the matter .
k02-023-s00-00.png	If anything , he had merely become a little more reserved , and
k02-023-s00-01.png	much more polite .
k02-023-s01-00.png	I thought to myself :
k02-023-s02-00.png	' A few years in the
k02-023-s02-01.png	East , my boy , and you 'll drink - I 've seen your kind be-
k02-023-s02-02.png	fore ! '
k02-023-s03-00.png	After the curry , I wanted only to go upstairs to
k02-023-s03-01.png	bed .
k02-023-s04-00.png	I had long since become accustomed , and now addicted ,
k02-023-s04-01.png	to an after-curry nap .
k02-023-s05-00.png	Verena Holenstein
k02-029-s00-00.png	Lee , however , showed not the slightest sign of fatigue .
k02-029-s01-00.png	' I
k02-029-s01-01.png	wonder if you 'd mind if I took a bit of a look round , '
k02-029-s01-02.png	he asked Nigel .
k02-029-s02-00.png	' I don't sleep in the afternoons . '
k02-029-s03-00.png	Nigel ,
k02-029-s03-01.png	I must say , was very good about it .
k02-029-s04-00.png	I knew how much
k02-029-s04-01.png	he probably wanted to sleep himself .
k02-029-s05-00.png	But , almost
k02-029-s05-01.png	gallantly , he said :
k02-036-s00-00.png	' Not at all .
k02-036-s01-00.png	I 'll show you . '
k02-036-s02-00.png	' Oh no , '
k02-036-s02-01.png	young Lee protested , considerate as always .
k02-036-s03-00.png	' That 's not necessary if you want to rest , sir .
k02-036-s04-00.png	I 'm sure I won't do any harm . '
k02-036-s05-00.png	Nigel
k02-036-s05-01.png	laughed .
k02-036-s06-00.png	I had not known he was so
k02-036-s06-01.png	good-natured .
k02-036-s07-00.png	But then , I suppose I had
k02-036-s07-01.png	never given him similar cause to display
k02-036-s07-02.png	such amiability .
k02-053-s00-00.png	I slept soundly , and much later than I should .
k02-053-s01-00.png	It
k02-053-s01-01.png	was already after six when I awoke , and the sun
k02-053-s01-02.png	was nearly setting beyond the west window .
k02-053-s02-00.png	Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices ,
k02-053-s02-01.png	and knew they were back .
k02-053-s03-00.png	I wondered , as I
k02-053-s03-01.png	wrapped a 6sarong around my waist , if
k02-053-s03-02.png	Nigel at all resented being deprived of his
k02-053-s03-03.png	afternoon sleep .
k02-062-s00-00.png	And I said to myself :
k02-062-s01-00.png	Oh , God , doesn't the
k02-062-s01-01.png	boy ever relax !
k02-062-s02-00.png	He turned his gaze away
k02-062-s02-01.png	from me almost instantly , but it had
k02-062-s02-02.png	been enough to make me conscious of the
k02-062-s02-03.png	nakedness of the upper half of my body , even
k02-062-s02-04.png	of the matted grey hairs on my chest .
k02-062-s03-00.png	He
k02-062-s03-01.png	probably thought my appearance quite a breach
k02-062-s03-02.png	of the social graces ; but , naturally , he said
k02-062-s03-03.png	not so much as a word about it .
k02-067-s00-00.png	' We 've just had tea , ' Nigel said .
k02-067-s01-00.png	' Would you like
k02-067-s01-01.png	the cookie to make you a fresh lot ? '
k02-067-s02-00.png	' I 'd rather
k02-067-s02-01.png	have whisky , ' I told him .
k02-067-s03-00.png	' Thought as much .
k02-067-s04-00.png	Sun 's nearly below the yard-arm , anyway .
k02-067-s05-00.png	Wouldn't mind a stengah myself .
k02-067-s06-00.png	How about
k02-067-s06-01.png	you , Harry ? '
k02-067-s07-00.png	So they had managed to come
k02-067-s07-01.png	to the stage of using each other's Christian
k02-067-s07-02.png	names , I noted .
k02-076-s00-00.png	Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as
k02-076-s00-01.png	reserved as I thought .
k02-076-s01-00.png	' Thanks ,
k02-076-s01-01.png	Nigel , ' he said .
k02-076-s02-00.png	' Just Coca-Cola .
k02-076-s03-00.png	Although I 'd like to have
k02-076-s03-01.png	whatever you have .
k02-076-s04-00.png	I want to
k02-076-s04-01.png	get to know the kind of life
k02-076-s04-02.png	people lead in the East , you know . '
k02-076-s05-00.png	At this , I felt a return of the
k02-076-s05-01.png	irritation I felt with him
k02-076-s05-02.png	at times .
k02-093-s00-00.png	Knowing Nigel , I would have been surprised if he
k02-093-s00-01.png	had not made his usual ' arrangements ' .
k02-093-s01-00.png	A bachelor
k02-093-s01-01.png	himself , he knew well how to entertain his bachelor
k02-093-s01-02.png	friends .
k02-093-s02-00.png	He caught my look and pursed his lips in
k02-093-s02-01.png	a quick little grimace of acknowledgement ; then raised
k02-093-s02-02.png	an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction .
k02-097-s00-00.png	I shrugged a shoulder .
k02-097-s01-00.png	Lee would have
k02-097-s01-01.png	to decide about that for himself , I
k02-097-s01-02.png	thought , and noticed that although he
k02-097-s01-03.png	was looking at the other girl , he did
k02-097-s01-04.png	so quite dispassionately , almost as though
k02-097-s01-05.png	he was merely interested in the unfamiliar
k02-097-s01-06.png	clothes she was wearing .
k02-097-s02-00.png	And I thought
k02-097-s02-01.png	to myself :
k02-097-s03-00.png	He may be still too much of
k02-097-s03-01.png	a ' new chum ' to see ' the beauty of
k02-097-s03-02.png	the East ' .
k02-102-s00-00.png	There was still an ease in our conversation , but its
k02-102-s00-01.png	scope was restricted .
k02-102-s01-00.png	I felt that I could hardly make the
k02-102-s01-01.png	usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
k02-102-s01-02.png	as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him , much as I
k02-102-s01-03.png	wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment .
k02-102-s02-00.png	And I suppose he felt the same .
k02-102-s03-00.png	We had only a few drinks ,
k02-102-s03-01.png	then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
k02-102-s03-02.png	dinner .
k02-112-s00-00.png	He had one of the better Kashmir carpets on
k02-112-s00-01.png	the floor .
k02-112-s01-00.png	His pictures and curtains , indeed I
k02-112-s01-01.png	suppose the entire furnishings , had been se-
k02-112-s01-02.png	lected personally .
k02-112-s02-00.png	The house was , as he
k02-112-s02-01.png	occasionally proclaimed , his home - and he had
k02-112-s02-02.png	made it as such .
k02-112-s03-00.png	I doubt if he will ever
k02-112-s03-01.png	leave Malaya , even when he retires .
k02-117-s00-00.png	The country , and his mistresses , have come
k02-117-s00-01.png	to mean too much to him .
k02-117-s01-00.png	And , indirectly ,
k02-117-s01-01.png	this impression I had of him was one of several
k02-117-s01-02.png	reasons why I had decided I should leave
k02-117-s01-03.png	it - before , for me too , it would be too late .
k02-117-s02-00.png	I used the excuse of our early start in the
k02-117-s02-01.png	morning to retire as soon as it seemed
k02-117-s02-02.png	prudent to do so , after the coffee and brandy ,
k02-117-s02-03.png	already anticipating the familiar pleasures
k02-117-s02-04.png	awaiting me .
k03-117-s00-00.png	After lunch two of the Prime Minister's
k03-117-s00-01.png	grandchildren who had sat , rather intimidated
k03-117-s00-02.png	by Ormston and staring at the Grinling
k03-117-s00-03.png	Gibbons carving around the fireplace , rose
k03-117-s00-04.png	gratefully from the table , leaving the two
k03-117-s00-05.png	men together .
k03-117-s01-00.png	A nurse came in , and asked
k03-117-s01-01.png	the Prime Minister if he wanted to be
k03-117-s01-02.png	helped out on to the lawn , but he waved
k03-117-s01-03.png	her away impatiently .
k03-138-s00-00.png	I don't mean just our direct military costs .
k03-138-s01-00.png	I 'm
k03-138-s01-01.png	thinking of the African Boycott which is already working up .
k03-138-s02-00.png	I 'm afraid , Prime Minister , you 're not going to like the
k03-138-s02-01.png	trading position when you see it . '
k03-138-s03-00.png	' I never do , ' the
k03-138-s03-01.png	Prime Minister commented wearily .
k03-138-s04-00.png	The Chancellor
k03-138-s04-01.png	was repeating an argument which he had already
k03-138-s04-02.png	developed for an hour before lunch .
k03-144-s00-00.png	' It comes at a bad time , ' said
k03-144-s00-01.png	Ormston .
k03-144-s01-00.png	' A singularly bad time .
k03-144-s02-00.png	The
k03-144-s02-01.png	Party 's very restless , you know . '
k03-144-s03-00.png	' It
k03-144-s03-01.png	is a sign of life - very encouraging ! '
k03-144-s04-00.png	' The younger men - '
k03-144-s05-00.png	' Which ones ? '
k03-144-s06-00.png	' The younger ones like Gore , Vaughan ,
k03-144-s06-01.png	Hadley , Prebble , Lambert-Price - the
k03-144-s06-02.png	New Africa lot - '
k03-144-s07-00.png	' Do they confide
k03-144-s07-01.png	in you ?
k03-144-s08-00.png	Have you spoken to them ? '
k03-152-s00-00.png	' Only at yesterday's meeting - they 're very restless , Prime
k03-152-s00-01.png	Minister .
k03-152-s01-00.png	They feel that it 's very old-fashioned - shooting
k03-152-s01-01.png	down mobs of natives .
k03-152-s02-00.png	They 're very much afraid that
k03-152-s02-01.png	if the Opposition get a Commission of Enquiry some
k03-152-s02-02.png	rather dismal stuff is going to come out . '
k03-152-s03-00.png	' Young back-benchers are always restive when they 're
k03-152-s03-01.png	bored , ' said the Prime Minister , and for the first
k03-152-s03-02.png	time since his grandchildren left the table , he smiled .
k03-157-s00-00.png	' Why don't you give them something to play with ? '
k03-157-s01-00.png	' They 've found their own toy , ' said Ormston ,
k03-157-s01-01.png	' and this is it .
k03-157-s02-00.png	They want to abstain next week . '
k03-157-s03-00.png	The Prime Minister continued in his flippant
k03-157-s03-01.png	tone ,
k03-157-s04-00.png	' Tell the Chief to give them a
k03-157-s04-01.png	talking-to . '
k03-157-s05-00.png	The Chancellor closed his eyes ,
k03-157-s05-01.png	and then said ,
k03-164-s00-00.png	' I think it 's gone beyond that , Prime Minister .
k03-164-s01-00.png	They feel pretty strongly about Africa .
k03-164-s02-00.png	They are greatly
k03-164-s02-01.png	disturbed by the new and rather ugly image of
k03-164-s02-02.png	the Party which our African policy is creating .
k03-164-s03-00.png	On the whole , the country is still in favour
k03-164-s03-01.png	of moderation and common sense .
k03-164-s04-00.png	Melville has
k03-164-s04-01.png	in a curious way made us look old-fashioned
k03-164-s04-02.png	- extravagant - nineteenth centuryish -
k03-164-s04-03.png	almost cranky . '
k03-180-s00-00.png	The Prime Minister looked puzzled , and said ,
k03-180-s01-00.png	' Julia Drayford ?
k03-180-s02-00.png	How
k03-180-s02-01.png	does she come into it ?
k03-180-s03-00.png	I can't follow these complexities - '
k03-180-s04-00.png	' It isn't
k03-180-s04-01.png	quite that .
k03-180-s05-00.png	The whole business blew up from Melville's disgraceful
k03-180-s05-01.png	indiscretion to Julia Drayford in Mrs. M'landa's presence .
k03-180-s06-00.png	I don't know the exact chain of gossip or who told who
k03-180-s06-01.png	what .
k04-000-s00-00.png	As he turned aside his head , since he could not
k04-000-s00-01.png	bear to look at her beautiful , pleading face , he was
k04-000-s00-02.png	suddenly attacked by suspicion .
k04-000-s01-00.png	' You wish to marry
k04-000-s01-01.png	someone else ! ' he cried in a voice roughened by
k04-000-s01-02.png	jealousy .
k04-000-s02-00.png	She sighed deeply , and looked away .
k04-000-s03-00.png	' Do you ?
k04-000-s03-01.png	Do you ? ' he repeated , fiercely .
k04-005-s00-00.png	' If , ' she said gently , giving him a look that set his pulses throbbing ,
k04-005-s00-01.png	' if I wished to marry some young gallant , do you think I would
k04-005-s00-02.png	ask your help ?
k04-005-s01-00.png	You would be the last man I would ask . '
k04-005-s02-00.png	Before
k04-005-s02-01.png	he could collect his wits to reply to this , there was a bustle
k04-005-s02-02.png	and confusion at the end of the room .
k04-005-s03-00.png	Prince Doria had
k04-005-s03-01.png	wearied of his toy and was packing it away in its painted
k04-005-s03-02.png	coffer .
k04-010-s00-00.png	The party was now preparing to see
k04-010-s00-01.png	the tapestries , and in the general
k04-010-s00-02.png	movement , Vittoria was separated from
k04-010-s00-03.png	Orsini .
k04-010-s01-00.png	Although neither of them
k04-010-s01-01.png	wished to follow the sightseers , there seemed
k04-010-s01-02.png	no alternative .
k04-010-s02-00.png	As she was about to mount
k04-010-s02-01.png	a wide and shallow flight of marble
k04-010-s02-02.png	stairs , she became aware of someone
k04-010-s02-03.png	watching her intently , and turning
k04-010-s02-04.png	in that direction , she saw Olimpia ,
k04-010-s02-05.png	standing beside her admirer , Orlando Cavalcanti .
k04-014-s00-00.png	The young man was bending over her with the
k04-014-s00-01.png	assiduity of a lover , but the girl appeared to be more
k04-014-s00-02.png	interested in her cousin's wife , whom she was regarding
k04-014-s00-03.png	through half-closed eyes .
k04-014-s01-00.png	This was a slight shock to
k04-014-s01-01.png	Vittoria , who had forgotten the existence of the girl ,
k04-014-s01-02.png	and , up to this moment had been unaware of the
k04-014-s01-03.png	young man's presence at the palazzo .
k04-017-s00-00.png	' Are you enjoying yourself , Olimpia ? ' she
k04-017-s00-01.png	asked idly , tapping the girl's cheek lightly with
k04-017-s00-02.png	her fan , in passing ; but she did not wait for
k04-017-s00-03.png	the answer .
k04-017-s01-00.png	Disturbed by vague uneasiness , she
k04-017-s01-01.png	was wondering whether Olimpia had been
k04-017-s01-02.png	watching her talk with Orsini .
k04-017-s02-00.png	Surely she
k04-017-s02-01.png	could not have overheard anything they
k04-017-s02-02.png	said ?
k04-017-s03-00.png	A moment's reflection reassured her
k04-017-s03-01.png	on that point , for she was certain no one
k04-017-s03-02.png	had been standing near them .
k04-022-s00-00.png	However , something inimical in the girl's look
k04-022-s00-01.png	put Vittoria on guard .
k04-022-s01-00.png	' Santa Maria !
k04-022-s02-00.png	These spying
k04-022-s02-01.png	eyes ! ' she thought , bitterly .
k04-022-s03-00.png	Doria was continually
k04-022-s03-01.png	stopping on the way , to point out , with childish pride ,
k04-022-s03-02.png	objects of beauty or interest .
k04-022-s04-00.png	Vittoria , on the
k04-022-s04-01.png	fringe of the party , caught snatches of this
k04-022-s04-02.png	information , which held no interest for her :
k04-022-s04-03.png	' ... now this sapphire ...
k04-028-s00-00.png	I like to think it may have fallen from the dark
k04-028-s00-01.png	hair of the Empress Messalina , as she crouched
k04-028-s00-02.png	in terror in the gardens of Lucullus , awaiting the
k04-028-s00-03.png	sword of the executioner . '
k04-028-s01-00.png	' Ah ! ' exclaimed
k04-028-s01-01.png	Farnese , with a snigger .
k04-028-s02-00.png	' The old cuckold
k04-028-s02-01.png	Claudius had the last word , after all .
k04-028-s03-00.png	He
k04-028-s03-01.png	knew how to deal with an adulterous wife ,
k04-028-s03-02.png	eh , Orsini ? '
k04-033-s00-00.png	If the duke made any reply to this , Vittoria did
k04-033-s00-01.png	not hear it .
k04-033-s01-00.png	Now they entered the long gallery
k04-033-s01-01.png	where they dispersed and wandered around , admiring
k04-033-s01-02.png	and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric
k04-033-s01-03.png	splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought
k04-033-s01-04.png	back from Lepanto .
k04-033-s02-00.png	After a short interval , Orsini
k04-033-s02-01.png	found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria .
k04-033-s03-00.png	' We must talk further , ' he said in a low
k04-033-s03-01.png	urgent voice .
k04-033-s04-00.png	' Where ? '
k04-039-s00-00.png	' Be careful , ' she whispered from behind her fan .
k04-039-s01-00.png	' Olimpia is watching us .
k04-039-s02-00.png	The young man with her is
k04-039-s02-01.png	Orlando Cavalcanti , Francesco's friend . '
k04-039-s03-00.png	Orsini
k04-039-s03-01.png	shot an impatient glance at the couple .
k04-039-s04-00.png	' The young man
k04-039-s04-01.png	with the mole ? '
k04-039-s05-00.png	' Yes , indeed . '
k04-039-s06-00.png	' No matter .
k04-039-s07-00.png	They are not
k04-039-s07-01.png	looking at us .
k04-039-s08-00.png	Now I must know , ' he whispered , ' what
k04-039-s08-01.png	you meant , cara mia .
k04-039-s09-00.png	Do you want your freedom in order
k04-039-s09-01.png	to marry ? '
k04-050-s00-00.png	Before replying to this , she glanced
k04-050-s00-01.png	hastily around , then spoke in tones so low that he
k04-050-s00-02.png	had to bend his head to hear :
k04-050-s01-00.png	' I will never be
k04-050-s01-01.png	any man's mistress .
k04-050-s02-00.png	As to marrying again ...
k04-050-s02-01.png	if I were free ... there is only one man I would
k04-050-s02-02.png	wish to marry ... but ... he , like myself , is now
k04-050-s02-03.png	bound . '
k04-054-s00-00.png	With a swift gesture she closed her fan
k04-054-s00-01.png	and moved away from him towards the group
k04-054-s00-02.png	in the centre of the gallery , leaving him standing
k04-054-s00-03.png	alone , against that glowing , barbaric background ,
k04-054-s00-04.png	with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face .
k04-054-s01-00.png	On a bright unclouded morning a few days after
k04-054-s01-01.png	the visit to the Doria Palace , the cardinal's
k04-054-s01-02.png	coach left the villa , lurched over the unpaved
k04-054-s01-03.png	track and turned towards the ruined Baths
k04-054-s01-04.png	of Diocletian .
k04-057-s00-00.png	Vittoria , accompanied by her maid , Lucia , was on her
k04-057-s00-01.png	way to the Accoramboni villa , ostensibly to pay
k04-057-s00-02.png	a daughterly call on her father , actually to coax
k04-057-s00-03.png	money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting
k04-057-s00-04.png	debts .
k04-057-s01-00.png	Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress
k04-057-s01-01.png	looked , and how cunningly the olive-green dress
k04-057-s01-02.png	with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
k04-057-s01-03.png	perfect figure .
k04-057-s02-00.png	Vittoria's thoughts were more complex .
k04-061-s00-00.png	The sparkling society of the Doria Palace , the flattery
k04-061-s00-01.png	of Orsini's obsession , the thwarted ambitions of her
k04-061-s00-02.png	restless spirit , all threw into sharp relief the contrast
k04-061-s00-03.png	of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
k04-061-s00-04.png	her dreams .
k04-061-s01-00.png	At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien ,
k04-061-s01-01.png	and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco
k04-061-s01-02.png	to give her a separate establishment , he invariably
k04-061-s01-03.png	pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle , who
k04-061-s01-04.png	had built the villa for his family .
k04-064-s00-00.png	He reminded her that they must abide by Roman
k04-064-s00-01.png	custom , and dwell there with their relations .
k04-064-s01-00.png	Her
k04-064-s01-01.png	values were those of the materialist who assesses
k04-064-s01-02.png	every human being in terms of fame , power and
k04-064-s01-03.png	wealth .
k04-064-s02-00.png	Francesco she despised for his dullness , his
k04-064-s02-01.png	lack of initiative , his subservience to his uncle .
k04-068-s00-00.png	Her husband's gentleness and amiability , his unselfish
k04-068-s00-01.png	love for her , she regarded as signs of weakness .
k04-068-s01-00.png	He was a
k04-068-s01-01.png	futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
k04-068-s01-02.png	her a child .
k04-068-s02-00.png	Whatever passion she had experienced in the
k04-068-s02-01.png	first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt .
k04-068-s03-00.png	She had never loved him .
k04-068-s04-00.png	Her thoughts rushed to Orsini .
k04-068-s05-00.png	Since the meeting in the Doria Palace , no word had
k04-068-s05-01.png	come from him , and this silence oppressed her spirits
k04-068-s05-02.png	with a weight of misgiving .
k04-075-s00-00.png	She had , perhaps , demanded too much .
k04-075-s01-00.png	The
k04-075-s01-01.png	kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus-
k04-075-s01-02.png	pected depths in her , and she knew that
k04-075-s01-03.png	if she yielded to him , her passion could ,
k04-075-s01-04.png	indeed , match his .
k04-075-s02-00.png	Every instinct urged her to
k04-075-s02-01.png	surrender , for there was that in his nature
k04-075-s02-02.png	to which her own had responded as it
k04-075-s02-03.png	had responded to no other human being .
k04-079-s00-00.png	Prudence , ambition and reason had
k04-079-s00-01.png	held instinct in check , and they must
k04-079-s00-02.png	dictate her course .
k04-079-s01-00.png	There could be no
k04-079-s01-01.png	compromise .
k04-079-s02-00.png	For a brief interval
k04-079-s02-01.png	she allowed herself the luxury of
k04-079-s02-02.png	dreams .
k04-079-s03-00.png	She began to imagine life at
k04-079-s03-01.png	Bracciano , the balls and fe*?5tes , the
k04-079-s03-02.png	conversation of poets and dilettanti .
k04-079-s04-00.png	She
k04-079-s04-01.png	visualized the pageantry of the tourna-
k04-079-s04-02.png	ment , and herself on the ducal dais beside
k04-079-s04-03.png	Orsini , placing a chaplet of roses on the brows
k04-085-s00-00.png	This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a
k04-085-s00-01.png	sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop , nearly throwing
k04-085-s00-02.png	the two girls from their seats .
k04-085-s01-00.png	Lucia uttered a cry of
k04-085-s01-01.png	alarm .
k04-085-s02-00.png	' Look , madonna , we are surrounded ! '
k04-085-s03-00.png	It was true .
k04-085-s04-00.png	Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about
k04-085-s04-01.png	them and a lean , swarthy fellow was peering through
k04-085-s04-02.png	the window , grinning impudently .
k04-085-s05-00.png	' Santa Maria ! '
k04-085-s05-01.png	shrieked Lucia .
k04-085-s06-00.png	' Banditti ! '
k04-093-s00-00.png	Vittoria now realized that they were outside
k04-093-s00-01.png	Santa Maria degli Angeli , and that except for a few beggars
k04-093-s00-02.png	crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting
k04-093-s00-03.png	loathsome sores , the area was deserted .
k04-093-s01-00.png	' They are not banditti ,
k04-093-s01-01.png	Lucia , ' said Vittoria , pointing to the badge on the man's
k04-093-s01-02.png	shoulder .
k04-093-s02-00.png	The words were clear .
k04-093-s03-00.png	' Beware my hug ! '
k04-093-s04-00.png	Lucia
k04-093-s04-01.png	stared speechlessly at the golden bear ; Vittoria swiftly
k04-093-s04-02.png	averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
k04-093-s04-03.png	of the retainer .
k04-099-s00-00.png	Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic .
k04-099-s01-00.png	The
k04-099-s01-01.png	coach now turned in another direction , towards
k04-099-s01-02.png	the wild and desolate region behind the baths .
k04-099-s02-00.png	It was sparsely inhabited , dotted with fallow fields
k04-099-s02-01.png	and terraced vineyards , and here and there jutted
k04-099-s02-02.png	a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins , a pathetic
k04-099-s02-03.png	reminder of Rome's former greatness .
k04-103-s00-00.png	In this region of Monti most of the public baths
k04-103-s00-01.png	had been built in the time of the Caesars , but with the
k04-103-s00-02.png	breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
k04-103-s00-03.png	the baths had lost their purpose ; they had become
k04-103-s00-04.png	stone quarries and their precious marble had been
k04-103-s00-05.png	burnt for lime .
k04-103-s01-00.png	Now escaped criminals and bandits
k04-103-s01-01.png	used these quarries as hiding places , to the danger
k04-103-s01-02.png	of travellers in the district .
k04-106-s00-00.png	As they lumbered past at a rattling pace , Vittoria
k04-106-s00-01.png	could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
k04-106-s00-02.png	gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
k04-106-s00-03.png	gathered about it , cooking their frugal meal .
k04-106-s01-00.png	These
k04-106-s01-01.png	were left far behind .
k04-106-s02-00.png	An old man belabouring an
k04-106-s02-01.png	overladen donkey , and a withered crone appeared
k04-106-s02-02.png	on the horizon , were overtaken and forgotten .
k04-110-s00-00.png	Except for their escort , Vittoria and
k04-110-s00-01.png	Lucia might have been the only living
k04-110-s00-02.png	creatures on an empty planet .
k04-110-s01-00.png	After the
k04-110-s01-01.png	initial shock , Vittoria felt calm .
k04-110-s02-00.png	She
k04-110-s02-01.png	knew exactly what she wanted , and
k04-110-s02-02.png	was prepared to take it without scruple ,
k04-110-s02-03.png	if she could .
k04-110-s03-00.png	What she had forgotten
k04-110-s03-01.png	in her self-absorption in her own schemes
k04-110-s03-02.png	was that other people were equally absorbed
k04-110-s03-03.png	in their schemes , which were likely to
k04-110-s03-04.png	run counter to her own .
k04-115-s00-00.png	This move today was a reminder of that fact .
k04-115-s01-00.png	Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
k04-115-s01-01.png	the agitated Lucia , her brain was working
k04-115-s01-02.png	rapidly , and she decided that she must be
k04-115-s01-03.png	prepared to counter Orsini's demands ,
k04-115-s01-04.png	difficult though that would be .
k04-115-s02-00.png	She became
k04-115-s02-01.png	aware that the pace was slackening ;
k04-115-s02-02.png	now the coach stopped .
k04-119-s00-00.png	The moment had come .
k04-119-s01-00.png	Upon the ensuing interview
k04-119-s01-01.png	the future would depend .
k04-119-s02-00.png	Outwardly she was calm , but
k04-119-s02-01.png	her heart was beating fast , and the palms of her
k04-119-s02-02.png	hands were damp .
k04-119-s03-00.png	Orsini's high-crowned hat with
k04-119-s03-01.png	its jaunty plume blotted out the light ; his hand
k04-119-s03-02.png	was on the door .
k04-119-s04-00.png	Glancing at Lucia he said in
k04-119-s04-01.png	French to Vittoria :
k04-119-s05-00.png	' Your maid ... is she reliable ? '
k04-126-s00-00.png	She shrugged her shoulders , and replied in the same
k04-126-s00-01.png	language :
k04-126-s01-00.png	' Yes .
k04-126-s02-00.png	But make it worth her while . '
k04-126-s03-00.png	' I see .
k04-126-s04-00.png	I know how to deal with people like that , '
k04-126-s04-01.png	and turning to the cowering Lucia , he spoke in her
k04-126-s04-02.png	own language .
k04-126-s05-00.png	' Do you know who I am ? '
k04-126-s06-00.png	' No ,
k04-126-s06-01.png	signor , ' she whispered .
k04-126-s07-00.png	' I am the Orsini .
k04-126-s08-00.png	My word is
k04-126-s08-01.png	law in Rome . '
k04-136-s00-00.png	Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat .
k04-136-s01-00.png	Thrusting his head farther into the coach , he said
k04-136-s01-01.png	sombrely :
k04-136-s02-00.png	' Have you ever heard of a punishment called
k04-136-s02-01.png	the cord ? '
k04-136-s03-00.png	She blanched and shrank away .
k04-136-s04-00.png	Was there not
k04-136-s04-01.png	a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda
k04-136-s04-02.png	where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty , fifty ,
k04-136-s04-03.png	sixty feet into the air , and dropped again and again , until
k04-136-s04-04.png	their arms were wrenched from their sockets . ' You have
k04-136-s04-05.png	heard of it ?
k04-142-s00-00.png	The Orsini give that to traitors .
k04-142-s01-00.png	There is
k04-142-s01-01.png	no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini .
k04-142-s02-00.png	We hunt
k04-142-s02-01.png	a traitor down to the ends of the earth , and no
k04-142-s02-02.png	power can save him ... or her .
k04-142-s03-00.png	Do you understand ? '
k04-142-s04-00.png	' Yes , signor , ' she faltered .
k04-142-s05-00.png	' On the other hand , ' he
k04-142-s05-01.png	continued , giving her a keen look , ' the Orsini are
k04-142-s05-02.png	generous to those who serve them faithfully .
k04-149-s00-00.png	Remember that , my girl . '
k04-149-s01-00.png	Lucia was beyond
k04-149-s01-01.png	speech .
k04-149-s02-00.png	He turned to Vittoria , sitting erect ,
k04-149-s02-01.png	with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with
k04-149-s02-02.png	anger .
k04-149-s03-00.png	' And now , madonna , ' he said smoothly , ' we will
k04-149-s03-01.png	continue the conversation started at the Doria
k04-149-s03-02.png	Palace .
k04-149-s04-00.png	Be pleased to alight . '
k04-149-s05-00.png	' I think , ' she replied
k04-149-s05-01.png	coolly , ' I prefer to stay where I am . '
k04-156-s00-00.png	' In that case , ' he reverted to French , ' I shall be obliged
k04-156-s00-01.png	to lift you from the coach . '
k04-156-s01-00.png	Without answering him , she
k04-156-s01-01.png	rose , and bending over the agitated girl , said softly :
k04-156-s02-00.png	' No one will harm you , Lucia .
k04-156-s03-00.png	Remain here . '
k04-156-s04-00.png	Ignoring his
k04-156-s04-01.png	proffered hand , she stepped from the vehicle .
k04-156-s05-00.png	' Will you
k04-156-s05-01.png	be so good as to order your men not to molest my
k04-156-s05-02.png	maid , ' she said coldly to Orsini .
k04-163-s00-00.png	' She is absolutely safe , ' he replied ; but he turned ,
k04-163-s00-01.png	nevertheless , to the man who had peered into the
k04-163-s00-02.png	coach , whom he had addressed as Luigi , and gave him sharp
k04-163-s00-03.png	instructions on the matter .
k04-163-s01-00.png	Vittoria stood looking about her ,
k04-163-s01-01.png	breathing the scent of thyme .
k04-163-s02-00.png	The land at her feet sloped
k04-163-s02-01.png	away into a tiny valley beyond which , on the crest
k04-163-s02-02.png	of a wooded hill-side , the ruins of a small temple
k04-163-s02-03.png	were etched against the clear blue of the sky .
k07-059a-s00-00.png	He forgot time and place .
k07-059a-s01-00.png	He , the master , was gently
k07-059a-s01-01.png	led along erotic paths which he knew existed , but
k07-059a-s01-02.png	had never trodden .
k07-059a-s02-00.png	He learned how to use his
k07-059a-s02-01.png	hands , how to adore that body without haste , how
k07-059a-s02-02.png	to caress every inch with his mouth as well , to
k07-059a-s02-03.png	creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
k07-059a-s02-04.png	himself in a rapture of kisses in places he 'd
k07-059a-s02-05.png	dreamed of , where life began to ooze and quickened
k07-059a-s02-06.png	his heart beat to a thunder .
k07-063a-s00-00.png	He looked at her .
k07-063a-s01-00.png	Head thrown back in a pool of hair ,
k07-063a-s01-01.png	her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
k07-063a-s01-02.png	heart in the full throat .
k07-063a-s02-00.png	Her mouth did things he
k07-063a-s02-01.png	thought no human being could stand without
k07-063a-s02-02.png	dying , but he went on living in an ocean of
k07-063a-s02-03.png	voluptuousness , that swelled and ebbed over him ,
k07-063a-s02-04.png	under him , in him and through him ...
k07-067a-s00-00.png	He was having a ball !
k07-067a-s01-00.png	He twiddled the TV set with
k07-067a-s01-01.png	shaking hands .
k07-067a-s02-00.png	She sat calmly on the bed smoking
k07-067a-s02-01.png	a cigarette .
k07-067a-s03-00.png	His face was white with two red
k07-067a-s03-01.png	blotches .
k07-067a-s04-00.png	Hers was flushed and lovely .
k07-067a-s05-00.png	O.K. teacher !
k07-067a-s06-00.png	Was that any better ?
k07-067a-s07-00.png	You know it was !
k07-067a-s08-00.png	You don't
k07-067a-s08-01.png	need teaching , only a little coaxing .
k07-077-s00-00.png	He sat down and ran his finger down along her
k07-077-s00-01.png	spine .
k07-077-s01-00.png	Do you love me now ?
k07-077-s02-00.png	Like yesterday !
k07-077-s03-00.png	I 'm
k07-077-s03-01.png	extremely fond of you .
k07-077-s04-00.png	The fact that you 're beginning
k07-077-s04-01.png	to satisfy my physical wants does not change that .
k07-077-s05-00.png	Before long you 'll give me the satisfaction that 'll set
k07-077-s05-01.png	me rocking on my feet , but I 'll still be only fond of
k07-077-s05-02.png	you .
k07-077-s06-00.png	But you wouldn't marry me ?
k07-085-s00-00.png	No .
k07-085-s01-00.png	I 'm not your type .
k07-085-s02-00.png	I 'd make you miserable .
k07-085-s03-00.png	I
k07-085-s03-01.png	mean that .
k07-085-s04-00.png	I 'd very probably be unfaithful and
k07-085-s04-01.png	that 'd kill you .
k07-085-s05-00.png	Then I 'd be unfaithful too , to teach
k07-085-s05-01.png	you a lesson .
k07-085-s06-00.png	It wouldn't work .
k07-085-s07-00.png	You 'd do it to
k07-085-s07-01.png	spite me .
k07-085-s08-00.png	I would never do it for that reason .
k07-085-s09-00.png	To me it 'd be immaterial whether you 'd retaliate
k07-085-s09-01.png	or not .
k07-085-s10-00.png	You 'd go crazy if that situation arose .
k07-122-s00-00.png	To observe the colour rise in her cheek
k07-122-s00-01.png	and hear her breath come faster , to see
k07-122-s00-02.png	the slight beads of sweat come out on
k07-122-s00-03.png	her glistening skin and see her move
k07-122-s00-04.png	with uncontrolled rhythm .
k07-122-s01-00.png	To have her twist
k07-122-s01-01.png	in an attempt to receive a caress he was
k07-122-s01-02.png	purposely withholding , to hear her deep-throated
k07-122-s01-03.png	moan of full satisfaction and feel her
k07-122-s01-04.png	shivering , clawing surrender .
k07-125-s00-00.png	Not so dusty , she might say afterwards , drawing at
k07-125-s00-01.png	a cigarette .
k07-125-s01-00.png	It 's a wow ! he said .
k07-125-s02-00.png	She kissed
k07-125-s02-01.png	him motherly :
k07-125-s03-00.png	You just wait till you teach the
k07-125-s03-01.png	girl you really love .
k07-125-s04-00.png	He didn't protest any more
k07-125-s04-01.png	to say he loved her because he knew it to
k07-125-s04-02.png	be untrue .
k07-125-s05-00.png	Instead he said :
k07-125-s06-00.png	Will that be
k07-125-s06-01.png	better ?
k07-125-s07-00.png	She nodded :
k07-134-s00-00.png	It 's man's nature to teach and to teach those
k07-134-s00-01.png	we love is double pleasure .
k07-134-s01-00.png	And she
k07-134-s01-01.png	might add :
k07-134-s02-00.png	And don't forget to leave the
k07-134-s02-01.png	lights on .
k07-134-s03-00.png	You lose half the fun when you
k07-134-s03-01.png	fumble in the dark .
k07-134-s04-00.png	She had many direct
k07-134-s04-01.png	comments like that .
k07-134-s05-00.png	Once she quietly
k07-134-s05-01.png	pushed him back when he kissed her too
k07-134-s05-02.png	fully and too soon :
k07-141-s00-00.png	Oi , not yet , you oaf .
k07-141-s01-00.png	What do you think my
k07-141-s01-01.png	mouth is ?
k07-141-s02-00.png	A billposter's bucket to be
k07-141-s02-01.png	plunged in at random ?
k07-141-s03-00.png	He 'd learned to
k07-141-s03-01.png	laugh when something went wrong or the
k07-141-s03-02.png	situation became ludicrous , as when they
k07-141-s03-03.png	were both caught in the raw when he 'd
k07-141-s03-04.png	forgotten to lock his door and Derek
k07-141-s03-05.png	had walked in unexpectedly .
k07-146-s00-00.png	They 'd just had time to nip into the
k07-146-s00-01.png	bathroom and stood there shivering for
k07-146-s00-02.png	fifteen minutes while their guest was
k07-146-s00-03.png	smoking a cigarette waiting for him .
k07-146-s01-00.png	At last Derek got tired and left .
k07-146-s02-00.png	Just in time , erupted Charlie .
k07-146-s03-00.png	If he 'd
k07-146-s03-01.png	stayed any longer I 'd jolly well
k07-146-s03-02.png	have asked him to join us .
k07-146-s04-00.png	I 'm so
k07-146-s04-01.png	darned cold I could do with two men .
k07-152-s00-00.png	You perverted sex-maniac , you wouldn't
k07-152-s00-01.png	dare .
k07-152-s01-00.png	Show me what you can do and
k07-152-s01-01.png	I 'll tell you if you need help .
k07-152-s02-00.png	Once he came back to the subject
k07-152-s02-01.png	of her marriage and asked her why
k07-152-s02-02.png	she was going to marry her sculptor .
k07-152-s03-00.png	Because I love him , of course .
k07-152-s04-00.png	What do you think ?
k07-158-s00-00.png	But he 's a lot older , isn't he ?
k07-158-s01-00.png	I suppose so .
k07-158-s02-00.png	What attracts you ?
k07-158-s03-00.png	It can't be physical ?
k07-158-s04-00.png	Of course
k07-158-s04-01.png	not !
k07-158-s05-00.png	I love him for what he is
k07-158-s05-01.png	- he 's so great I 'm a bit scared
k07-158-s05-02.png	of him - a woman must be a bit
k07-158-s05-03.png	scared to be really in love .
k07-158-s06-00.png	That 's why you could never
k07-158-s06-01.png	love me ?
k07-166-s00-00.png	Correct , ducky !
k07-166-s01-00.png	You just wait till
k07-166-s01-01.png	you meet the girl who thinks you 're a
k07-166-s01-02.png	god .
k07-166-s02-00.png	It 'll make you feel like one !
k07-166-s03-00.png	You think that sculptor 's a god ?
k07-166-s04-00.png	Perhaps , in a way .
k07-166-s05-00.png	All I know is
k07-166-s05-01.png	that I need him .
k07-166-s06-00.png	He kissed the
k07-166-s06-01.png	heart beat in her throat .
k07-166-s07-00.png	But how
k07-166-s07-01.png	about the physical side ?
k07-166-s08-00.png	You 're
k07-166-s08-01.png	quite an erotic little beast ; can
k07-166-s08-02.png	he satisfy that ?
k07-176-s00-00.png	You youngsters always overestimate
k07-176-s00-01.png	yourselves .
k07-176-s01-00.png	You can take it from
k07-176-s01-01.png	me that he can and does .
k07-176-s02-00.png	But
k07-176-s02-01.png	even if he were impotent I 'd still
k07-176-s02-02.png	love and want him .
k07-176-s03-00.png	There are
k07-176-s03-01.png	sides to me you 'll never know .
k07-176-s04-00.png	Don't you feel guilty living with
k07-176-s04-01.png	me ?
k07-176-s05-00.png	Often !
k07-176-s06-00.png	Don't you ?
k07-176-s07-00.png	Mary had
k07-176-s07-01.png	married her bill broker some time
k07-176-s07-02.png	ago and he now shuddered when he
k07-176-s07-03.png	remembered the clinical weekends
k07-176-s07-04.png	he used to spend with her .
k07-185-s00-00.png	He often used to try to imagine
k07-185-s00-01.png	her reactions if he had once treated
k07-185-s00-02.png	her as he did Charlie , but his
k07-185-s00-03.png	imagination failed .
k07-185-s01-00.png	The efficient
k07-185-s01-01.png	little Mary would probably have
k07-185-s01-02.png	called it a shocking waste of time
k07-185-s01-03.png	and told him to get down to
k07-185-s01-04.png	business !
k07-185-s02-00.png	Charlie , who was perfectly
k07-185-s02-01.png	at home at all sorts of artistic
k07-185-s02-02.png	circles , had amongst others wangled
k07-185-s02-03.png	him a membership ticket for a
k07-185-s02-04.png	small club for artists only .
l01-000-s00-00.png	He did well .
l01-000-s01-00.png	He got in touch with
l01-000-s01-01.png	the woman Pete was passing off as his
l01-000-s01-02.png	mother .
l01-000-s02-00.png	Starmouth managed to
l01-000-s02-01.png	win her confidence .
l01-000-s03-00.png	It seems that
l01-000-s03-01.png	she was an honest enough woman ,
l01-000-s03-02.png	only her mind wasn't as clear as
l01-000-s03-03.png	it could have been .
l01-000-s04-00.png	She showed
l01-000-s04-01.png	him photographs .
l01-000-s05-00.png	He found out
l01-000-s05-01.png	that the name of her house - Grand
l01-000-s05-02.png	Greve - was taken from a bay
l01-000-s05-03.png	in one of the Channel Islands .
l01-007-s00-00.png	One of the small ones .
l01-007-s01-00.png	Sark , that 's it .
l01-007-s02-00.png	The Caxtons
l01-007-s02-01.png	used to have their holidays there .
l01-007-s03-00.png	Starmouth went
l01-007-s03-01.png	there .
l01-007-s04-00.png	He dug out some people who remembered
l01-007-s04-01.png	the family .
l01-007-s05-00.png	In the end he pieced it all together .
l01-007-s06-00.png	The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek .
l01-007-s07-00.png	Pete first met them at school .
l01-016-s00-00.png	It was a good school I sent him to , one of the best .
l01-016-s01-00.png	He was a boarder .
l01-016-s02-00.png	He could always turn on the
l01-016-s02-01.png	charm when it suited him .
l01-016-s03-00.png	The whole family
l01-016-s03-01.png	came to like him .
l01-016-s04-00.png	The real Michael - he was the
l01-016-s04-01.png	same age as my son - died of pleurisy when he
l01-016-s04-02.png	was eighteen .
l01-016-s05-00.png	Soon after that Pete staged his
l01-016-s05-01.png	drowning .
l01-023-s00-00.png	He was always a smooth liar .
l01-023-s01-00.png	He invented some
l01-023-s01-01.png	plausible story or other and threw himself on
l01-023-s01-02.png	the Caxtons' generosity .
l01-023-s02-00.png	They accepted him as a
l01-023-s02-01.png	kind of substitute for the boy they had lost .
l01-023-s03-00.png	Outside the family he began to pass himself
l01-023-s03-01.png	off as Michael Caxton .
l01-023-s04-00.png	The father was well-off
l01-023-s04-01.png	and easy-going .
l01-023-s05-00.png	He was easy meat for Pete .
l01-030-s00-00.png	He sponged off him until he died
l01-030-s00-01.png	just after the war .
l01-030-s01-00.png	Then Pete had to
l01-030-s01-01.png	look around for some other
l01-030-s01-02.png	security .
l01-030-s02-00.png	He found it - Dackson's Wharf ,
l01-030-s02-01.png	and Dackson's daughter .
l01-030-s03-00.png	Mrs. Caxton's
l01-030-s03-01.png	other boy , Derek , had been killed in the war .
l01-030-s04-00.png	After her husband died her brain began
l01-030-s04-01.png	to fade .
l01-030-s05-00.png	At times she thought Pete was
l01-030-s05-01.png	really her own son .
l01-050-s00-00.png	My chance had come at last .
l01-050-s01-00.png	I had to
l01-050-s01-01.png	take it .
l01-050-s02-00.png	I was going to smash him as
l01-050-s02-01.png	he had twice tried to smash me .
l01-050-s03-00.png	( His
l01-050-s03-01.png	eyes , wild and frightened , were fixed on
l01-050-s03-02.png	Tong .
l01-050-s04-00.png	Tong guessed that they did not
l01-050-s04-01.png	see him . )
l01-050-s05-00.png	I told Starmouth to go at
l01-050-s05-01.png	once and report exactly what he had
l01-050-s05-02.png	seen to Dackson and his daughter .
l01-050-s06-00.png	He did as he was told .
l01-065-s00-00.png	Carol Carstairs , interviewed by
l01-065-s00-01.png	Passon and Tong for the second time ,
l01-065-s00-02.png	began by agreeing that she could
l01-065-s00-03.png	have been mistaken about the
l01-065-s00-04.png	precise minute of Dackson's visit
l01-065-s00-05.png	the previous Wednesday , and ended
l01-065-s00-06.png	by admitting that he was in fact
l01-065-s00-07.png	at least half an hour late for
l01-065-s00-08.png	his appointment with her .
l01-065-s01-00.png	 There
l01-065-s01-01.png	it is , Passon commented
l01-065-s01-02.png	afterwards .
l01-065-s02-00.png	 She is a business
l01-065-s02-01.png	woman .
l01-082-s00-00.png	 Another was the body fetching up on the mooring-hook - practically where
l01-082-s00-01.png	it started from . 
l01-082-s01-00.png	 And you finding out about the spy at the Marshams' ,
l01-082-s01-01.png	 Passon said .
l01-082-s02-00.png	 Just a stroke of luck , sir , Tong said .
l01-082-s03-00.png	 Luck or not ,
l01-082-s03-01.png	Harry , it was the real turning-point for us .
l01-082-s04-00.png	Must be true what they
l01-082-s04-01.png	say .
l01-082-s05-00.png	' Tong can't go wrong ! ' 
l01-095-s00-00.png	When Nick returned home he found that his
l01-095-s00-01.png	mother was seriously ill .
l01-095-s01-00.png	She had pneumonia .
l01-095-s02-00.png	The
l01-095-s02-01.png	sight of her youngest son , the doctor said , was the
l01-095-s02-02.png	only thing that saved her ; it gave her the strength
l01-095-s02-03.png	she needed to fight for life .
l01-095-s03-00.png	Soon she was out of
l01-095-s03-01.png	danger , but the doctor told Dan that she would
l01-095-s03-02.png	have to remain in bed for some time and
l01-095-s03-03.png	that thereafter it was essential that she should
l01-095-s03-04.png	not have to exert herself .
l01-105-s00-00.png	With Grace helpless Rose set up her
l01-105-s00-01.png	own autocracy .
l01-105-s01-00.png	Her squeaking , querulous
l01-105-s01-01.png	accents were heard without inter-
l01-105-s01-02.png	mission .
l01-105-s02-00.png	They rose over the baby's inter-
l01-105-s02-01.png	minable howling and were directed at
l01-105-s02-02.png	everyone in equal measure .
l01-105-s03-00.png	She was
l01-105-s03-01.png	a poor and unpunctual cook .
l01-105-s04-00.png	Normally
l01-105-s04-01.png	indolent , she was now and again seized
l01-105-s04-02.png	with unpredictable bouts of energy in
l01-105-s04-03.png	the grip of which she swept through
l01-105-s04-04.png	the house with a fury that disarranged
l01-111-s00-00.png	Only the old man's room was too much for
l01-111-s00-01.png	her .
l01-111-s01-00.png	Once she put her head round the door ,
l01-111-s01-01.png	and Sam shouted :
l01-111-s02-00.png	 You get right out of
l01-111-s02-01.png	this , Rose .
l01-111-s03-00.png	You leave me in peace . 
l01-111-s04-00.png	Rose took one breath of the stagnant air .
l01-111-s05-00.png	 You - you polecat ! she screeched , and
l01-111-s05-01.png	retreated without argument .
l01-111-s06-00.png	Her re*?
l01-111-s06-01.png	2gime , hated alike by all the men ,
l01-111-s06-02.png	produced one extraordinary result .
l01-119-s00-00.png	One day Fred met Nick at the front door as they were both
l01-119-s00-01.png	about to enter the house .
l01-119-s01-00.png	Fred grasped his brother's elbow .
l01-119-s02-00.png	 Nick , I can't stomach this much longer . 
l01-119-s03-00.png	 Nor me .
l01-119-s04-00.png	What 's the
l01-119-s04-01.png	answer ?
l01-119-s05-00.png	Mum 's picking up , but she 'll never be her old self
l01-119-s05-01.png	again . 
l01-119-s06-00.png	 That First Flower 's driving me nuts , Fred said .
l01-119-s07-00.png	 I 'm going to put
l01-119-s07-01.png	a stop to it . 
l01-119-s08-00.png	 What with - arsenic ? 
l01-129-s00-00.png	Fred fixed his small eyes on his brother , beckoned
l01-129-s00-01.png	him to stand closer , and whispered into his
l01-129-s00-02.png	ear the most unexpected words Nick had
l01-129-s00-03.png	ever heard .
l01-129-s01-00.png	 I 'm going to get myself
l01-129-s01-01.png	married , Fred said .
l01-129-s02-00.png	The next day he
l01-129-s02-01.png	brought home a woman in her middle
l01-129-s02-02.png	thirties and took her straight to his
l01-129-s02-03.png	mother's bedside .
l01-133-s00-00.png	 Mum , this is Maggie .
l01-133-s01-00.png	I 'm going to marry her ,
l01-133-s01-01.png	and I 'd like her to come and live with us . 
l01-133-s02-00.png	Maggie was plump and plain with a pleasing
l01-133-s02-01.png	smile , a placid nature , and a slow-moving
l01-133-s02-02.png	but methodical mind .
l01-133-s03-00.png	For twenty years she
l01-133-s03-01.png	had worked in the bottling-store at the bre-
l01-133-s03-02.png	wery , and Grace heard with astonishment
l01-133-s03-03.png	that Fred had known her on and off
l01-133-s03-04.png	for nearly as long .
l01-143-s00-00.png	It was Nick who found the answer .
l01-143-s01-00.png	 Only
l01-143-s01-01.png	one thing for it , Mum , he said , sitting on
l01-143-s01-02.png	the edge of the bed and holding one
l01-143-s01-03.png	of her hands in his .
l01-143-s02-00.png	 Let Fred and
l01-143-s02-01.png	Mag have the two upstairs rooms
l01-143-s02-02.png	between them .
l01-143-s03-00.png	Sam will have to
l01-143-s03-01.png	come out of his kennel .
l01-157-s00-00.png	He argued that it was the only place where
l01-157-s00-01.png	he could be safe from Rose .
l01-157-s01-00.png	 See here , Sam , 
l01-157-s01-01.png	Nick began .
l01-157-s02-00.png	 You know Fred 's getting spliced . 
l01-157-s03-00.png	 Gone soft in the head , Sam said .
l01-157-s04-00.png	 Same as
l01-157-s04-01.png	I 've always said , women rule the roost and
l01-157-s04-02.png	no man 's safe from 'em .
l01-157-s05-00.png	Ought to be a
l01-157-s05-01.png	better way of doing things .
l01-157-s06-00.png	Take trees . 
l01-157-s07-00.png	He
l01-157-s07-01.png	rattled on very happily .
l01-173-s00-00.png	He propped himself on one elbow .
l01-173-s01-00.png	 You can't
l01-173-s01-01.png	do it to me , Nick .
l01-173-s02-00.png	I 've worked this room up to
l01-173-s02-01.png	my way of thinking like I 'd educate a child .
l01-173-s03-00.png	This room and me understands one another . 
l01-173-s04-00.png	 Sam , Nick said firmly , either you and
l01-173-s04-01.png	me share downstairs , and we have Mag , or
l01-173-s04-02.png	you stick it out up here and we all get
l01-173-s04-03.png	saddled with the First Flower for ever . 
l01-179-s00-00.png	Sam sank back on his pillow .
l01-179-s01-00.png	 Oh , my
l01-179-s01-01.png	God !
l01-179-s02-00.png	All right , you win ! 
l01-179-s03-00.png	With that settled
l01-179-s03-01.png	Fred was soon married .
l01-179-s04-00.png	The First Flower
l01-179-s04-01.png	snatched up her infant and departed , mut-
l01-179-s04-02.png	tering sarcasms .
l01-179-s05-00.png	The whole household
l01-179-s05-01.png	listened to the dwindling screams of the
l01-179-s05-02.png	baby with relief .
l01-179-s06-00.png	Maggie soon proved her
l01-179-s06-01.png	worth , and after a time Dan summed up
l01-179-s06-02.png	the general approval by saying :
l01-187-s00-00.png	 She 's as good a worker as you could wish for .
l01-187-s01-00.png	She speaks our language .
l01-187-s02-00.png	Mag 's one of us . 
l01-187-s03-00.png	Nick and his grandfather shared their bedroom
l01-187-s03-01.png	amicably .
l01-187-s04-00.png	The old man , though fighting a
l01-187-s04-01.png	grumbling rearguard action , permitted himself
l01-187-s04-02.png	gradually to become a little cleaner and
l01-187-s04-03.png	tidier .
l01-187-s05-00.png	In his heart he was well satisfied to
l01-187-s05-01.png	have Nick's company .
l01-187-s06-00.png	When they were alone
l01-187-s06-01.png	together he often explained all over again
l01-187-s06-02.png	how shrewd he had been in discovering
l01-187-s06-03.png	Alf Jesty's secret .
l01-195-s00-00.png	 Imagine it , Nick , just that bit of information
l01-195-s00-01.png	Fred picked up about Pete Jesty always touching
l01-195-s00-02.png	his nose , and me remembering from that
l01-195-s00-03.png	snap you once showed me that this Cax-
l01-195-s00-04.png	ton had some sort of a scar there .
l01-195-s01-00.png	Just
l01-195-s01-01.png	an idea to begin with , mind you - then
l01-195-s01-02.png	click ! and I 'd got it .
l01-195-s02-00.png	That was smart
l01-195-s02-01.png	work , say what you like . 
l01-199-s00-00.png	 It certainly was , Sam , Nick would agree , and go
l01-199-s00-01.png	on to say with a touch of self-importance :
l01-199-s01-00.png	 No
l01-199-s01-01.png	wonder he tried to have me suffocated back
l01-199-s01-02.png	last summer .
l01-199-s02-00.png	Must have thought I 'd
l01-199-s02-01.png	rumbled him right from the start . 
l01-199-s03-00.png	By this
l01-199-s03-01.png	time Nick was certain in his own mind
l01-199-s03-02.png	that he had really seen Caxton's hand
l01-199-s03-03.png	snatching at the prop holding the barge's
l01-199-s03-04.png	hatch open , though he could never prove it ,
l01-199-s03-05.png	and it would not be of much use if
l01-199-s03-06.png	he could .
l03-000-s00-00.png	The nose is one of the most pain-sensitive
l03-000-s00-01.png	organs in the human body - and
l03-000-s00-02.png	Malone was discovering the truth in
l03-000-s00-03.png	scientific detail .
l03-000-s01-00.png	Kennan had only
l03-000-s01-01.png	seconds left .
l03-000-s02-00.png	He jumped forward to
l03-000-s02-01.png	the far limit of his chain , his
l03-000-s02-02.png	right hand chopping edge-downwards
l03-000-s02-03.png	in bone-jarring force .
l03-004-s00-00.png	The blow took the writhing thug a fraction
l03-004-s00-01.png	above the boney knob which landmarked the cervical
l03-004-s00-02.png	plexus , the vital nerve-centre which a long-ago
l03-004-s00-03.png	Marine instructor had declared the pinnacle of unarmed
l03-004-s00-04.png	combat targets .
l03-004-s01-00.png	The thug collapsed with a whistling
l03-004-s01-01.png	moan , and Kennan tore the Luger from the man's
l03-004-s01-02.png	suddenly limp hand .
l03-004-s02-00.png	There was no time for
l03-004-s02-01.png	rejoicing , but the hard , firm shape of the
l03-004-s02-02.png	automatic sent a new confidence surging through
l03-004-s02-03.png	his body .
l03-008-s00-00.png	Shouts , and the clatter of feet meant
l03-008-s00-01.png	Goldie and Leo Grundy were on their
l03-008-s00-02.png	way .
l03-008-s01-00.png	Kennan pulled the manacle chain
l03-008-s01-01.png	taut , and blasted two shots at the
l03-008-s01-02.png	link which tied him to the ring-bolt in
l03-008-s01-03.png	the rock .
l03-008-s02-00.png	The nine-millimetre bullets sma-
l03-008-s02-01.png	shed the chain as if it had been plastic ,
l03-008-s02-02.png	and , free , though the chain still dangled ,
l03-008-s02-03.png	he threw himself across the floor
l03-008-s02-04.png	towards the entrance .
l04-000-s00-00.png	' Well , what do you think ? ' she scoffed , her
l04-000-s00-01.png	brilliant eyes challenging him .
l04-000-s01-00.png	He made no answer .
l04-000-s02-00.png	There was nothing to be said .
l04-000-s03-00.png	He lifted his glass
l04-000-s03-01.png	and drained it , feeling the sweat breaking out on the
l04-000-s03-02.png	palms of his hands .
l04-005-s00-00.png	When at last he looked up she was standing right
l04-005-s00-01.png	in front of him , smiling as if nothing had happened !
l04-005-s01-00.png	He could hardly believe it and blinked several times .
l04-005-s02-00.png	' Well , don't I get a drink tonight ? ' she asked boldly .
l04-005-s03-00.png	' Of course ... anything you like ' , he murmured ,
l04-005-s03-01.png	relief flooding over him .
l04-005-s04-00.png	' Kitty ... I 'm sorry ... . '
l04-005-s05-00.png	His throat went tight and words failed him .
l04-012-s00-00.png	' Aw , forget it ' , she said cheerfully .
l04-012-s01-00.png	' I 'll sting
l04-012-s01-01.png	you for a double for being a naughty boy .
l04-012-s02-00.png	How about the telly tomorrow afternoon ? '
l04-012-s03-00.png	He felt a glow of happiness steal over him .
l04-012-s04-00.png	Everything was all right now , thank God .
l04-012-s05-00.png	She
l04-012-s05-01.png	wasn't going to break with him , after all .
l04-012-s06-00.png	For the moment it was the only thing in the
l04-012-s06-01.png	world that mattered .
l04-020-s00-00.png	' Of course , Kitty ' , he said fervently , his eyes misty
l04-020-s00-01.png	behind their thick lenses .
l04-020-s01-00.png	' Well , I 'll be off now .
l04-020-s02-00.png	See you
l04-020-s02-01.png	tomorrow ... and thank you ... . '
l04-020-s03-00.png	' So long , Bob ' , she said ,
l04-020-s03-01.png	waving her hand to him .
l04-020-s04-00.png	Harry followed him to the
l04-020-s04-01.png	door , opened it for him and stood outside on the step ,
l04-020-s04-02.png	looking up at the sky , where a few pale stars shone
l04-020-s04-03.png	between puffs of light cumulus cloud .
l04-026-s00-00.png	' Nice night ' , he remarked affably .
l04-026-s01-00.png	' But they forecast rain
l04-026-s01-01.png	for tomorrow . '
l04-026-s02-00.png	' Do they ? '
l04-026-s03-00.png	Bone glanced up at the sky , his
l04-026-s03-01.png	thoughts elsewhere .
l04-026-s04-00.png	Personally , he didn't care if it rained cats
l04-026-s04-01.png	and dogs and he knew that Harry didn't either .
l04-026-s05-00.png	He waited ,
l04-026-s05-01.png	pulling on his gloves and adjusting his hat .
l04-026-s06-00.png	' Look , Bob , '
l04-026-s06-01.png	Harry began , after a brief silence , ' I don't mean to
l04-026-s06-02.png	butt in , but if you take my advice you 'll 'ave no
l04-026-s06-03.png	more truck with 'er . '
l04-034-s00-00.png	He jerked his thumb over his
l04-034-s00-01.png	shoulder .
l04-034-s01-00.png	' That girl 's nothing but a load
l04-034-s01-01.png	of trouble , I 'm warning you . '
l04-034-s02-00.png	' Kitty 's
l04-034-s02-01.png	all right ' , Bone contradicted flatly .
l04-034-s03-00.png	' It 's
l04-034-s03-01.png	her boy-friend that 's the trouble .
l04-034-s04-00.png	If
l04-034-s04-01.png	we could get rid of him ... '
l04-034-s05-00.png	Harry
l04-034-s05-01.png	nodded his grizzled head like an old
l04-034-s05-02.png	hound .
l04-034-s06-00.png	' You 're right there , Bob ' , he
l04-034-s06-01.png	muttered .
l04-034-s07-00.png	' But it 's easier said than done .
l04-043-s00-00.png	Kitty encourages him , too .
l04-043-s01-00.png	No work , no
l04-043-s01-01.png	background , no regular money so far as I
l04-043-s01-02.png	can make out .
l04-043-s02-00.png	Probably on the crook .
l04-043-s03-00.png	But there you are , the girl 's wild and
l04-043-s03-01.png	headstrong .
l04-043-s04-00.png	I can't do nothing with 'er . '
l04-043-s05-00.png	' Don't worry , Harry ' , the other said quietly .
l04-043-s06-00.png	' I won't make a fool of myself .
l04-043-s07-00.png	Kitty needs a good friend and I 'll
l04-043-s07-01.png	always be that . '
l04-052-s00-00.png	He paused , hatred of Stevie Hewitt
l04-052-s00-01.png	rising like gall in his throat .
l04-052-s01-00.png	' And I 'll find a way of getting rid of
l04-052-s01-01.png	that chap , Hewitt , too .
l04-052-s02-00.png	Leave it to me . '
l04-052-s03-00.png	' O.K. , Bob , but watch your step .
l04-052-s04-00.png	He 's
l04-052-s04-01.png	a tough customer , mark my words ' , Harry
l04-052-s04-02.png	said in a low voice .
l04-052-s05-00.png	Bone half smiled
l04-052-s05-01.png	in the darkness .
l04-052-s06-00.png	' I 'll remember ' , he said .
l04-052-s07-00.png	' Good night , Harry . '
l04-052-s08-00.png	' Good night , Bob . '
l04-062-s00-00.png	Bone walked down the road , his cre*?
l04-062-s00-01.png	5pe-soled shoes making no sound
l04-062-s00-02.png	on the asphalt surface .
l04-062-s01-00.png	As he walked
l04-062-s01-01.png	he concentrated on the problem of
l04-062-s01-02.png	Stevie Hewitt .
l04-062-s02-00.png	By comparison with the
l04-062-s02-01.png	manner in which he had dispatched
l04-062-s02-02.png	Henry Mansell the elimination of a
l04-062-s02-03.png	little spiv from Brighton seemed an
l04-062-s02-04.png	easy undertaking ... once he 'd set
l04-062-s02-05.png	his mind to it .
l04-066-s00-00.png	Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate
l04-066-s00-01.png	it beside the fire in the living-room , his thoughts once
l04-066-s00-02.png	more on Kitty .
l04-066-s01-00.png	If she was really in love with Stevie
l04-066-s01-01.png	Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her , he
l04-066-s01-02.png	told himself moodily .
l04-066-s02-00.png	Yet it was not as clear-cut as that .
l04-066-s03-00.png	He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware
l04-066-s03-01.png	of the necessity to help and protect her , even against
l04-066-s03-02.png	her will .
l04-071-s00-00.png	Tonight , for the first time , he had abandoned all
l04-071-s00-01.png	pretence and shown her the honest desperation of his feeling
l04-071-s00-02.png	for her .
l04-071-s01-00.png	She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected
l04-071-s01-01.png	him .
l04-071-s02-00.png	In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged
l04-071-s02-01.png	a bond between them .
l04-071-s03-00.png	No doubt she had every intention
l04-071-s03-01.png	of keeping both of them on a string .
l04-071-s04-00.png	On the whole he probably
l04-071-s04-01.png	had a slight advantage over the young man , inasmuch as he
l04-071-s04-02.png	had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy
l04-071-s04-03.png	respect for the material things of life .
l04-082-s00-00.png	Sentence Database L04-082
l04-082-s01-00.png	But he was still no sort of match for a young
l04-082-s01-01.png	and virile competitor and he knew it .
l04-082-s02-00.png	He turned
l04-082-s02-01.png	away and begun to undress , shivering with the
l04-082-s02-02.png	cold .
l04-082-s03-00.png	His eye automatically glanced towards the
l04-082-s03-01.png	panel which concealed the hiding-place of his
l04-082-s03-02.png	secret treasure .
l04-082-s04-00.png	For an instant he stood
l04-082-s04-01.png	transfixed to the floor , his eyes unwavering
l04-082-s04-02.png	as they riveted themselves on the wall .
l04-087-s00-00.png	Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided ?
l04-087-s01-00.png	Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
l04-087-s01-01.png	panel and pulled it out .
l04-087-s02-00.png	The black tin box was exactly
l04-087-s02-01.png	as he had left it .
l04-087-s03-00.png	With heavily beating heart he reached
l04-087-s03-01.png	out and lifted the lid .
l04-087-s04-00.png	Everything was intact and he
l04-087-s04-01.png	gasped with relief .
l04-093-s00-00.png	He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
l04-093-s00-01.png	to count them .
l04-093-s01-00.png	Of course , he remembered being in a great hurry to get
l04-093-s01-01.png	that fifty pounds for Kitty !
l04-093-s02-00.png	Obviously he had been careless in
l04-093-s02-01.png	replacing the panel , but the possibility of anyone having
l04-093-s02-02.png	discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock .
l04-093-s03-00.png	As he replaced the bundles of notes , he withdrew the tin
l04-093-s03-01.png	box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
l04-093-s03-02.png	cupboard .
l04-098-s00-00.png	It would be safer under lock and key
l04-098-s00-01.png	for the time being than behind a piece
l04-098-s00-02.png	of panelling which did not fit very sec-
l04-098-s00-03.png	urely .
l04-098-s01-00.png	Tomorrow he would buy a
l04-098-s01-01.png	heavy padlock for the box and search
l04-098-s01-02.png	for a new hiding-place .
l04-098-s02-00.png	He lay in bed ,
l04-098-s02-01.png	cold and uneasy , unable to account
l04-098-s02-02.png	for an instinctive sense of danger .
l04-102-s00-00.png	When he closed his eyes it was
l04-102-s00-01.png	Henry Mansell's face he saw , hovering
l04-102-s00-02.png	above his head like a hideous caricature .
l04-102-s01-00.png	The
l04-102-s01-01.png	parrot nose and straight line of the mouth ,
l04-102-s01-02.png	the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip
l04-102-s01-03.png	him right down to his abjectly quaking
l04-102-s01-04.png	bones .
l04-102-s02-00.png	The mouldering horror that had
l04-102-s02-01.png	once been Henry Mansell taunted him
l04-102-s02-02.png	now in the silent darkness .
l04-106-s00-00.png	In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at
l04-106-s00-01.png	Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy
l04-106-s00-02.png	Dowell drank their beer and waited .
l04-106-s01-00.png	' It 's too damn busy
l04-106-s01-01.png	in here .
l04-106-s02-00.png	We can't expect him to leave his customers ' ,
l04-106-s02-01.png	Hugh said morosely .
l04-106-s03-00.png	' Give him a chance , old chap .
l04-106-s04-00.png	He 'll be over .
l04-106-s05-00.png	Jim 's a most reliable chap when
l04-106-s05-01.png	it comes to picking up a small tip . '
l04-113-s00-00.png	' O.K. , Roddy , whatever you say . '
l04-113-s01-00.png	Hugh drained his glass and
l04-113-s01-01.png	ordered two more beers .
l04-113-s02-00.png	' I 'm really beginning to feel it 's
l04-113-s02-01.png	all a bit of a waste of time , anyway .
l04-113-s03-00.png	I 've been collecting
l04-113-s03-01.png	scraps of evidence and piecing them together for four
l04-113-s03-02.png	months now , and the whole lot still doesn't amount to
l04-113-s03-03.png	anything one could call concrete . '
l04-118-s00-00.png	Roddy puffed at his pipe , his eyes fixed on the white-coated
l04-118-s00-01.png	barman .
l04-118-s01-00.png	' Oh , I think it does , Hugh .
l04-118-s02-00.png	That 's
l04-118-s02-01.png	why I want you to meet this bird .
l04-118-s03-00.png	I think
l04-118-s03-01.png	he fills in an important part of the
l04-118-s03-02.png	background .
l04-118-s04-00.png	Furthermore , dear boy , it confirms
l04-118-s04-01.png	what we already know of your father's
l04-118-s04-02.png	intention to leave the country on the night
l04-118-s04-03.png	of October 14th . '
l04-124-s00-00.png	Hugh nodded .
l04-124-s01-00.png	His face wore the melancholy expression
l04-124-s01-01.png	that was habitual to him but his eyes showed
l04-124-s01-02.png	his inner excitement .
l04-124-s02-00.png	' I know , but from the
l04-124-s02-01.png	moment he walked out of here we haven't a
l04-124-s02-02.png	shred of evidence to prove what happened .
l04-124-s03-00.png	Obviously he met someone , either by chance or
l04-124-s03-01.png	by arrangement .
l04-124-s04-00.png	Whichever way it was , that
l04-124-s04-01.png	person had a gun and he managed to persuade
l04-124-s04-02.png	Father to drive along that quiet stretch of
l04-124-s04-03.png	road ... . '
l04-130-s00-00.png	' Miles off his proper route to Dover or the airport at
l04-130-s00-01.png	Lydd ' , Roddy interposed quickly .
l04-130-s01-00.png	' And once there he was
l04-130-s01-01.png	shot at close range and his money smartly filched .
l04-130-s02-00.png	You know , whoever it was might have known of the
l04-130-s02-01.png	existence of the suicide letter ... providing him with
l04-130-s02-02.png	an almost unshakable alibi . '
l04-130-s03-00.png	Hugh was thinking of
l04-130-s03-01.png	his uncle , but said nothing .
l04-130-s04-00.png	After all , Julian had
l04-130-s04-01.png	acted very strangely since the tragedy , always
l04-130-s04-02.png	secretive , always reluctant to discuss his brother's
l04-130-s04-03.png	death .
l04-136-s00-00.png	It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a
l04-136-s00-01.png	cold-blooded murder but , in fact , Henry Mansell's
l04-136-s00-02.png	death had saved the firm and Julian's future .
l04-136-s01-00.png	Moreover he might well have been aware of his
l04-136-s01-01.png	brother's intention to skip out of the country and
l04-136-s01-02.png	passed on the information .
l04-136-s02-00.png	' I 'm sure you 're right ' ,
l04-136-s02-01.png	Hugh said thoughtfully .
l04-136-s03-00.png	' But whoever did it got
l04-136-s03-01.png	clean away without being spotted . '
l04-141-s00-00.png	' Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter ,
l04-141-s00-01.png	believe me ' , Roddy affirmed solemnly .
l04-141-s01-00.png	' He probably caught
l04-141-s01-01.png	the next boat across the channel and has been lying low
l04-141-s01-02.png	with the money somewhere . '
l04-141-s02-00.png	Hugh nodded .
l04-141-s03-00.png	' I realized that
l04-141-s03-01.png	after my talk with Mrs. Lawford .
l04-141-s04-00.png	There are a dozen countries
l04-141-s04-01.png	where a man could easily hide up and change the money
l04-141-s04-02.png	without danger .
l04-147-s00-00.png	Unless we can get a definite line on him it 's
l04-147-s00-01.png	hopeless ... . '
l04-147-s01-00.png	' Something will turn up one day , you 'll see ' ,
l04-147-s01-01.png	Roddy said confidently .
l04-147-s02-00.png	' If we plug away at the leads
l04-147-s02-01.png	we have ... . '
l04-147-s03-00.png	' If only the police would do something ... ' Hugh
l04-147-s03-01.png	cried out in exasperation .
l04-147-s04-00.png	' I 've put everything I know
l04-147-s04-01.png	before them ... . '
l04-153-s00-00.png	' No dice , Hugh . '
l04-153-s01-00.png	Roddy shook his sandy head .
l04-153-s02-00.png	' They 're bound to want pretty solid new evidence
l04-153-s02-01.png	before they 'll agree to reopen the case .
l04-153-s03-00.png	From
l04-153-s03-01.png	their point of view the evidence for suicide is
l04-153-s03-02.png	overwhelming .
l04-153-s04-00.png	I spoke to a chap from the office of
l04-153-s04-01.png	the Director of Public Prosecutions I know pretty
l04-153-s04-02.png	well , and he agreed that the missing cash is
l04-153-s04-03.png	a hell of a mystery .
l04-159-s00-00.png	But as he quite reasonably pointed out the
l04-159-s00-01.png	money could have been disposed of in London
l04-159-s00-02.png	before your father left that evening .
l04-159-s01-00.png	It wouldn't be
l04-159-s01-01.png	unnatural for a man in his position to make provision
l04-159-s01-02.png	for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded
l04-159-s01-03.png	as particular debts of honour before taking his own
l04-159-s01-04.png	life .
l04-159-s02-00.png	Also , logically , there 's nothing to show the
l04-159-s02-01.png	money couldn't have been pinched by someone
l04-159-s02-02.png	passing the car after your father was dead .
l04-163-s00-00.png	Stealing from cars is about the commonest
l04-163-s00-01.png	kind of crime in the book .
l04-163-s01-00.png	There 's nothing
l04-163-s01-01.png	that absolutely ties the missing money to the
l04-163-s01-02.png	circumstances of your father 's death , that 's
l04-163-s01-03.png	the point .
l04-163-s02-00.png	Same with the passport .
l04-163-s03-00.png	It 's gone
l04-163-s03-01.png	and that 's that .
l04-163-s04-00.png	It may turn up in a dustbin
l04-163-s04-01.png	somewhere or at the back of a drawer .
l04-163-s05-00.png	As
l04-163-s05-01.png	far as the police are concerned there 's nothing
l04-163-s05-02.png	to go on .
l04-170-s00-00.png	In our own minds we may be pretty sure what
l04-170-s00-01.png	happened , but that 's not good enough for them .
l04-170-s01-00.png	That suicide letter did the trick - definite proof
l04-170-s01-01.png	that your father took his life , backed by
l04-170-s01-02.png	medical evidence and the fingerprint chaps . '
l04-170-s02-00.png	A little man with thin brown hair and a
l04-170-s02-01.png	ruddy complexion came over and greeted
l04-170-s02-02.png	them .
l04-174-s00-00.png	He wore a short white coat .
l04-174-s01-00.png	Hugh ordered drinks .
l04-174-s02-00.png	' I was sorry to read about your dad in the
l04-174-s02-01.png	paper ' , the man said to Hugh in a thick
l04-174-s02-02.png	voice which bore traces of a cockney accent .
l04-174-s03-00.png	' I was telling your friend how he come
l04-174-s03-01.png	in here the very night he passed away . '
l04-179-s00-00.png	Hugh wasn't impressed with this ingratiating bar-
l04-179-s00-01.png	man whom Roddy had raked up .
l04-179-s01-00.png	He was seedy and
l04-179-s01-01.png	middle-aged with small black eyes set close to-
l04-179-s01-02.png	gether beneath heavily marked brows and a sly ,
l04-179-s01-03.png	crafty expression that failed to inspire confidence .
l04-179-s02-00.png	' He was hitting the bottle pretty hard , sir ... ' the
l04-179-s02-01.png	man said in a loud whisper .
l04-179-s03-00.png	' Meaning no offe-
l04-179-s03-01.png	nce ' , he added , looking at Hugh .
l07-052-s00-00.png	 Why ? he asked again .
l07-052-s01-00.png	 I can tell by your voice that it means
l07-052-s01-01.png	a lot to you , but I 'm damned if I can see the reason .
l07-052-s02-00.png	It 's not as
l07-052-s02-01.png	if you were all that fond of Alice . 
l07-052-s03-00.png	He was interrupted by the
l07-052-s03-01.png	arrival of the food and wine .
l07-052-s04-00.png	When the pouring ritual was over he
l07-052-s04-01.png	went on :
l07-065-s00-00.png	If he didn't do it it must have been - 
l07-065-s01-00.png	 Must have been
l07-065-s01-01.png	who ? Max prompted .
l07-065-s02-00.png	I looked into his eyes and longed
l07-065-s02-01.png	with all my heart to tell him , but I could not do it .
l07-065-s03-00.png	As long as my suspicion remained in my head I could pretend
l07-065-s03-01.png	to myself , in moments of optimism , that it was not true .
l07-074-s00-00.png	If you 're right , you may be in serious danger from Hardy .
l07-074-s01-00.png	Even if you 're wrong you 'll most certainly be in danger when
l07-074-s01-01.png	you start handling a boat . 
l07-074-s02-00.png	He picked up his glass and
l07-074-s02-01.png	held it in both hands , looking at me thoughtfully over the
l07-074-s02-02.png	top of it .
l07-074-s03-00.png	 No , he said at last .
l07-074-s04-00.png	 I can't allow # #
l07-074-s04-01.png	it . 
l07-080-s00-00.png	 You can't very well stop me . 
l07-080-s01-00.png	 I can
l07-080-s01-01.png	do better than that .
l07-080-s02-00.png	If we were to
l07-080-s02-01.png	get married now I could come
l07-080-s02-02.png	with you . 
l07-080-s03-00.png	I looked down at my
l07-080-s03-01.png	plate , not daring to let him see
l07-080-s03-02.png	how much the idea appealed to
l07-080-s03-03.png	me , reminding myself that he could
l07-080-s03-04.png	only have said such a thing
l07-080-s03-05.png	because he did not know the
l07-080-s03-06.png	whole truth .
l07-085-s00-00.png	 And I can't allow that , I said .
l07-085-s01-00.png	 Deadlock , said Max .
l07-085-s02-00.png	 No , it isn't .
l07-085-s03-00.png	I 'm determined to go , and by myself ,
l07-085-s03-01.png	whatever you say . 
l07-085-s04-00.png	 I was afraid of
l07-085-s04-01.png	that . 
l07-085-s05-00.png	He sounded resigned but none
l07-085-s05-01.png	the less hopeful .
l07-085-s06-00.png	 You 're a very
l07-085-s06-01.png	wilful woman but I 'll change
l07-085-s06-02.png	your mind for you one of these
l07-085-s06-03.png	days .
l07-103-s00-00.png	 You can see it any time you like , 
l07-103-s00-01.png	he told me .
l07-103-s01-00.png	 The sooner the better .
l07-103-s02-00.png	If you can get to Bletcham this
l07-103-s02-01.png	evening I 'll run you up there
l07-103-s02-02.png	in the car . 
l07-103-s03-00.png	 That 's very nice of
l07-103-s03-01.png	you . 
l07-103-s04-00.png	 Nice , nothing .
l07-103-s05-00.png	I told you ,
l07-103-s05-01.png	I 'm mad about boats .
l07-103-s06-00.png	Seven
l07-103-s06-01.png	thirty do you ?
l07-111-s00-00.png	I could meet you at the bus station . 
l07-111-s01-00.png	 No , I said , outside your office . 
l07-111-s02-00.png	I could not endure the thought
l07-111-s02-01.png	of another wait at the bus station .
l07-111-s03-00.png	He was there punctually .
l07-111-s04-00.png	Dressed
l07-111-s04-01.png	in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated
l07-111-s04-02.png	shorts he looked hardly more than
l07-111-s04-03.png	a boy , a cheerful , good-natured
l07-111-s04-04.png	boy .
l07-111-s05-00.png	He settled me into the car
l07-111-s05-01.png	with touching care and then
l07-111-s05-02.png	drove like a fiend along
l07-111-s05-03.png	the river road .
l07-118-s00-00.png	Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane
l07-118-s00-01.png	and helped me out with the same
l07-118-s00-02.png	careful courtesy .
l07-118-s01-00.png	 What sort of boat is it ? 
l07-118-s01-01.png	I asked .
l07-118-s02-00.png	 She , he corrected .
l07-118-s03-00.png	 She 's a
l07-118-s03-01.png	converted life-boat .
l07-118-s04-00.png	Not a very good one ,
l07-118-s04-01.png	but she 's sound enough and the
l07-118-s04-02.png	engine 's fine . 
l07-131-s00-00.png	Inside , she was untidy and grubby but
l07-131-s00-01.png	roomy enough and well lit by two rows of
l07-131-s00-02.png	good-sized windows .
l07-131-s01-00.png	It was a long time
l07-131-s01-01.png	before I got used to calling them
l07-131-s01-02.png	portholes .
l07-131-s02-00.png	The owner was a middle-aged
l07-131-s02-01.png	man whose family had tired of the
l07-131-s02-02.png	limited excitement of the river and now
l07-131-s02-03.png	had their eyes on a seagoing boat .
l07-135-s00-00.png	Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
l07-135-s00-01.png	haggled with him and within half an hour
l07-135-s00-02.png	Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
l07-135-s00-03.png	fifty pounds .
l07-135-s01-00.png	When all the business details
l07-135-s01-01.png	had been settled and the owner had
l07-135-s01-02.png	departed with my cheque in his pocket ,
l07-135-s01-03.png	Clive started the engine and gave me my
l07-135-s01-04.png	first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
l07-135-s01-05.png	the river and in and out of the other boats .
l07-138-s00-00.png	It was a warm , still evening ; the plop of
l07-138-s00-01.png	fish and the gentle putter of the engine
l07-138-s00-02.png	were infinitely soothing after city noises ,
l07-138-s00-03.png	and I began to look forward to my life
l07-138-s00-04.png	on the water .
l07-138-s01-00.png	At last he pronounced
l07-138-s01-01.png	me riverworthy and wanted to know when
l07-138-s01-02.png	I would be moving in .
l07-172-s00-00.png	Like Clive , he was enthusiastic about the
l07-172-s00-01.png	engine and decided , apparently on the strength
l07-172-s00-02.png	of its efficiency , that Sandpiper was fit to
l07-172-s00-03.png	live in .
l07-172-s01-00.png	I was more than thankful for his help
l07-172-s01-01.png	when we had installed my things and the
l07-172-s01-02.png	boat began to move .
l07-172-s02-00.png	The river was crowded
l07-172-s02-01.png	with flocks of sailing boats which
l07-172-s02-02.png	swirled round us like gulls and there
l07-172-s02-03.png	were two locks to negotiate , but Max
l07-172-s02-04.png	seemed to know exactly what to do
l07-172-s02-05.png	and at the same time kept me supplied
l07-176-s00-00.png	 How on earth do you know all this ? I asked
l07-176-s00-01.png	him .
l07-176-s01-00.png	 I used to play about in these things
l07-176-s01-01.png	when I was a kid .
l07-176-s02-00.png	And then I acted as guide
l07-176-s02-01.png	on a river boat one summer , to keep myself
l07-176-s02-02.png	going between terms at college . 
l07-176-s03-00.png	It was
l07-176-s03-01.png	the first I had heard of it , but that 's
l07-176-s03-02.png	one of the things I like about Max .
l07-181-s00-00.png	He has done so many things that there
l07-181-s00-01.png	is always something new and exciting to
l07-181-s00-02.png	discover about him .
l07-181-s01-00.png	 You 're wonderful , I
l07-181-s01-01.png	said , meaning it .
l07-181-s02-00.png	He pressed the tip of my
l07-181-s02-01.png	nose with one finger .
l07-181-s03-00.png	 That makes two of us . 
l07-181-s04-00.png	It was about eight o'clock in the evening
l07-181-s04-01.png	when we tied up almost exactly opposite
l07-181-s04-02.png	Hardy's garden and went up on to the
l07-181-s04-03.png	roof of the cabin to see what we could see .
l07-187-s00-00.png	From this side , Rivermead was less forbidding ;
l07-187-s00-01.png	it stood a long way back from the water
l07-187-s00-02.png	at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
l07-187-s00-03.png	flowering trees and shrubs .
l07-187-s01-00.png	To the right of
l07-187-s01-01.png	the lawn , close to the water's edge , stood an
l07-187-s01-02.png	ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria ; it
l07-187-s01-03.png	was built across a narrow backwater
l07-187-s01-04.png	and there was a delicate iron staircase
l07-187-s01-05.png	climbing the outer wall to a room above .
l07-190-s00-00.png	 You won't see anyone tonight , it 's too late , Max
l07-190-s00-01.png	said and turned to go .
l07-190-s01-00.png	 No - wait , I put out a
l07-190-s01-01.png	hand to stop him .
l07-190-s02-00.png	The sun was no longer shining
l07-190-s02-01.png	and it was dark across there by the trees ,
l07-190-s02-02.png	but I thought I had seen something move .
m01-000-s00-00.png	A shudder , more mental than physical , ran
m01-000-s00-01.png	through him , and his mind seemed to
m01-000-s00-02.png	melt away into emptiness .
m01-000-s01-00.png	His bulging
m01-000-s01-01.png	eyes caught the reclining form of Heather ,
m01-000-s01-02.png	who was still repeating in sing-song :
m01-000-s02-00.png	 ... I will not give in ... 
m01-000-s03-00.png	He stared at her
m01-000-s03-01.png	blankly , mouthing an incoherent gabble
m01-000-s03-02.png	of half words .
m01-012-s00-00.png	He slapped himself in the face and
m01-012-s00-01.png	cuffed the sides of his head .
m01-012-s01-00.png	Then
m01-012-s01-01.png	by degrees the rotating objects
m01-012-s01-02.png	slowed , and coming into focus took
m01-012-s01-03.png	the form of the furnishings in Dan
m01-012-s01-04.png	Brown's living room .
m01-012-s02-00.png	He stood up un-
m01-012-s02-01.png	steadily and looked about the room ,
m01-012-s02-02.png	trying to gather his wits .
m01-012-s03-00.png	Outside the
m01-012-s03-01.png	dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
m01-012-s03-02.png	the heights beyond were in
m01-012-s03-03.png	silhouette , already a solid black .
m01-017-s00-00.png	He bumped into a floor lamp and
m01-017-s00-01.png	switched it on .
m01-017-s01-00.png	Heather McNabb still lay
m01-017-s01-01.png	on the couch , her body uncomfortably twisted
m01-017-s01-02.png	and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks .
m01-017-s02-00.png	He went to the kitchen for water and found
m01-017-s02-01.png	Dan .
m01-017-s03-00.png	Dan was lying on a long bench in the
m01-017-s03-01.png	breakfast nook , his head bent upright
m01-017-s03-02.png	against the wall .
m01-022-s00-00.png	His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat ,
m01-022-s00-01.png	as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks
m01-022-s00-02.png	brought forward .
m01-022-s01-00.png	He mouthed a low mutter , punctuated at intervals
m01-022-s01-01.png	with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon .
m01-022-s02-00.png	As
m01-022-s02-01.png	Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut ,
m01-022-s02-02.png	with jaws askew .
m01-026-s00-00.png	There was utter imbecility in his blank face .
m01-026-s01-00.png	Presently the
m01-026-s01-01.png	muttering started again , and went on and on .
m01-026-s02-00.png	Stunned and
m01-026-s02-01.png	shaken , Steve drew a glass of water and went back to
m01-026-s02-02.png	Heather .
m01-026-s03-00.png	Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
m01-026-s03-01.png	trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects .
m01-026-s04-00.png	For several minutes they had been facing each other across
m01-026-s04-01.png	a low table , like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with
m01-026-s04-02.png	each other through forced association .
m01-032-s00-00.png	Then something like a zest for living began to come back
m01-032-s00-01.png	to Steve and he squeezed her hand .
m01-032-s01-00.png	Her face took on
m01-032-s01-01.png	enough animation to produce a wan smile .
m01-032-s02-00.png	Dan's low mut-
m01-032-s02-01.png	tering was just audible from the kitchen .
m01-032-s03-00.png	And Steve
m01-032-s03-01.png	could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions
m01-032-s03-02.png	she was growing cold and numb with shock .
m01-032-s04-00.png	She had seen
m01-032-s04-01.png	Dan , or rather the physical relic of him - the empty
m01-032-s04-02.png	shell of flesh and bone , devoid of intellect and
m01-032-s04-03.png	personality .
m01-038-s00-00.png	And these had been his great qualities ,
m01-038-s00-01.png	so attractive to her .
m01-038-s01-00.png	The Base Station had
m01-038-s01-01.png	gone before , discharging its narrow plane of
m01-038-s01-02.png	4ementalating energy along the length of
m01-038-s01-03.png	the Earth's imaginary longitudes , moving
m01-038-s01-04.png	eastward like a knife-edged twilight in
m01-038-s01-05.png	reversed progression .
m01-038-s02-00.png	It had brought the
m01-038-s02-01.png	First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest ,
m01-038-s02-02.png	the empty-minded receptiveness that
m01-038-s02-03.png	prepared the way for the Second Stage .
m01-049-s00-00.png	He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
m01-049-s00-01.png	and came into the livingroom , where
m01-049-s00-02.png	Heather and Steve stood aghast at
m01-049-s00-03.png	his entrance .
m01-049-s01-00.png	He came , almost falling
m01-049-s01-01.png	forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck
m01-049-s01-02.png	thrust out , arms dangling loosely .
m01-049-s02-00.png	Then , abruptly , he drew himself up
m01-049-s02-01.png	and walked on the very tips of
m01-049-s02-02.png	his toes .
m01-049-s03-00.png	He stretched his arms
m01-049-s03-01.png	over his head and yawned agape ,
m01-049-s03-02.png	drawing-in great breaths that
m01-049-s03-03.png	became great sighs of ecstacy .
m01-060-s00-00.png	 They have come ! he said reverently , gripping his
m01-060-s00-01.png	hands together between his knees and leaning
m01-060-s00-02.png	forward .
m01-060-s01-00.png	 Isn't it a glorious thing !
m01-060-s02-00.png	Long awaited
m01-060-s02-01.png	transcendent event , the exalted desire of all
m01-060-s02-02.png	mankind through all ages !
m01-060-s03-00.png	The Kingdom of the
m01-060-s03-01.png	Mind is at hand ! 
m01-060-s04-00.png	He turned beaming eyes
m01-060-s04-01.png	upward and shook his head slowly from
m01-060-s04-02.png	side to side .
m01-079-s00-00.png	A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
m01-079-s00-01.png	abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
m01-079-s00-02.png	at an intersection for the light to change .
m01-079-s01-00.png	At his
m01-079-s01-01.png	apartment he garaged his car and then stood
m01-079-s01-02.png	listening in the night .
m01-079-s02-00.png	Listening in vain .
m01-079-s03-00.png	For the
m01-079-s03-01.png	earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart
m01-079-s03-02.png	loses its beat in death .
m01-084-s00-00.png	Deadly stillness , deadly portent !
m01-084-s01-00.png	Steve awakened early and switched on
m01-084-s01-01.png	the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO.
m01-084-s02-00.png	The set lighted-up but gave only a low
m01-084-s02-01.png	buzzing sound .
m01-084-s03-00.png	He had just finished
m01-084-s03-01.png	shaving when it came on , with a flat
m01-084-s03-02.png	voice repeating :
m01-084-s04-00.png	 This is BBC calling
m01-084-s04-01.png	... this is BBC calling ... 
m01-090-s00-00.png	After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice
m01-090-s00-01.png	went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
m01-090-s00-02.png	in Sussex , in all its obscene details .
m01-090-s01-00.png	Then the radio
m01-090-s01-01.png	went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for
m01-090-s01-02.png	breakfast .
m01-090-s02-00.png	It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June
m01-090-s02-01.png	should be .
m01-090-s03-00.png	Steve got out the car and traversed the
m01-090-s03-01.png	same empty streets as he had the night before ,
m01-090-s03-02.png	to keep an appointment with Heather .
m01-095-s00-00.png	Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
m01-095-s00-01.png	Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop .
m01-095-s01-00.png	A
m01-095-s01-01.png	flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
m01-095-s01-02.png	the War Memorial .
m01-095-s02-00.png	There was a deep
m01-095-s02-01.png	whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing
m01-095-s02-02.png	overtone that sang in his ears with an
m01-095-s02-03.png	almost painful sharpness .
m01-095-s03-00.png	He reversed and
m01-095-s03-01.png	turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
m01-100-s00-00.png	The Thetans must not see him !
m01-100-s01-00.png	He took another route
m01-100-s01-01.png	to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on
m01-100-s01-02.png	the way .
m01-100-s02-00.png	Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at
m01-100-s02-01.png	once ; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss
m01-100-s02-02.png	their situation , as far as it could be assessed ,
m01-100-s02-03.png	and to decide on what seemed to be the best
m01-100-s02-04.png	way of meeting it .
m01-104-s00-00.png	 The Thetans , he said , are presumably here to
m01-104-s00-01.png	take charge , as it were , of the minds of the
m01-104-s00-02.png	people - who are probably falling all over them-
m01-104-s00-03.png	selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
m01-104-s00-04.png	them out .
m01-104-s01-00.png	Just what these orders will be , we don't
m01-104-s01-01.png	know .
m01-104-s02-00.png	Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-
m01-104-s02-01.png	caped Thetan subjugation .
m01-104-s03-00.png	This time .
m01-104-s04-00.png	But we no
m01-104-s04-01.png	longer have any immunity .
m01-110-s00-00.png	There can be little doubt that if the
m01-110-s00-01.png	Thetans discover our mental independence
m01-110-s00-02.png	they will promptly give us their hypnotic
m01-110-s00-03.png	treatment .
m01-110-s01-00.png	If we can avoid undue
m01-110-s01-01.png	prominence , it may be that we can
m01-110-s01-02.png	move about pretty freely without
m01-110-s01-03.png	detection .
m01-110-s02-00.png	If we can - well , then we
m01-110-s02-01.png	may be able to promote our own
m01-110-s02-02.png	interests .
m01-110-s03-00.png	What those interests
m01-110-s03-01.png	are , beyond personal security ,
m01-110-s03-02.png	I haven't a clue ; but , who knows ,
m01-110-s03-03.png	we may form the nucleus around ...
m01-115-s00-00.png	 Now , to summarize what I think our
m01-115-s00-01.png	course of action should be .
m01-115-s01-00.png	First , to avoid the
m01-115-s01-01.png	Thetans like the plague , for they must not
m01-115-s01-02.png	find us out !
m01-115-s02-00.png	Second , to tread pretty warily
m01-115-s02-01.png	among our own people , finding out just how
m01-115-s02-02.png	much freedom we can take with safety .
m01-115-s03-00.png	And third , to study these damned Thetans .
m01-115-s04-00.png	We must learn all we can about
m01-115-s04-01.png	them .
m01-121-s00-00.png	There is just a hope that we may uncover
m01-121-s00-01.png	some weakness , and find a way of fighting
m01-121-s00-02.png	back at them . 
m01-121-s01-00.png	Heather agreed , and suggested
m01-121-s01-01.png	that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
m01-121-s01-02.png	ting how the Thetan machinations had been
m01-121-s01-03.png	working out .
m01-121-s02-00.png	It occurred to Steve that this may
m01-121-s02-01.png	not have been entirely an objective suggestion
m01-121-s02-02.png	on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
m01-121-s02-03.png	nevertheless .
m01-125-s00-00.png	So they proceeded to see if the coast
m01-125-s00-01.png	was clear .
m01-125-s01-00.png	The street was quiet and
m01-125-s01-01.png	deserted , and there were neither sight
m01-125-s01-02.png	nor sound of flying saucers .
m01-125-s02-00.png	So they
m01-125-s02-01.png	ventured forth and made their way on
m01-125-s02-02.png	foot to Dan's house .
m01-125-s03-00.png	Dan came
m01-125-s03-01.png	to the door at their ring but neglected
m01-125-s03-02.png	to offer any greeting .
m01-125-s04-00.png	He was deeply
m01-125-s04-01.png	preoccupied , and it seemed that the
m01-125-s04-02.png	ringing of a doorbell was to him
m01-125-s04-03.png	a new and strange phenomenon .
m01-131-s00-00.png	When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action
m01-131-s00-01.png	gave the impression of having been thought out and
m01-131-s00-02.png	decided upon .
m01-131-s01-00.png	Inside they sat down unbidden , while
m01-131-s01-01.png	Dan paced the floor .
m01-131-s02-00.png	He seemed completely unaware
m01-131-s02-01.png	of their presence .
m01-131-s03-00.png	They just stared at him , turning
m01-131-s03-01.png	their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
m01-131-s03-02.png	down , up and down .
m01-136-s00-00.png	His whole attitude was a mixture of
m01-136-s00-01.png	impatience pending an awaited
m01-136-s00-02.png	communication and of a vague
m01-136-s00-03.png	perplexity respecting his surroundings
m01-136-s00-04.png	and the purpose he was to serve .
m01-136-s01-00.png	Finally , being so obviously on their own ,
m01-136-s01-01.png	Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
m01-136-s01-02.png	at home .
m01-136-s02-00.png	Steve switched on Dan's
m01-136-s02-01.png	powerful , world-wide radio and systematically
m01-136-s02-02.png	turned the tuning knob through all the
m01-136-s02-03.png	tuning points of the world's great radio
m01-149-s00-00.png	They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where
m01-149-s00-01.png	he waited .
m01-149-s01-00.png	The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
m01-149-s02-00.png	But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
m01-149-s02-01.png	the Avenue from its many tributary streets .
m01-149-s03-00.png	It might have
m01-149-s03-01.png	been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies .
m01-149-s04-00.png	First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone
m01-149-s04-01.png	walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of
m01-149-s04-02.png	a single all-exclusive purpose .
m01-160-s00-00.png	After a long wait a bus appeared and they
m01-160-s00-01.png	followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking
m01-160-s00-02.png	seats some rows behind him .
m01-160-s01-00.png	Steve was
m01-160-s01-01.png	beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy
m01-160-s01-02.png	faces very disconcerting ; and looking at
m01-160-s01-03.png	Heather he found a welcome relief in her
m01-160-s01-04.png	relatively long doleful one
m02-048-s00-00.png	Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
m02-048-s00-01.png	real days and would return to New York in late
m02-048-s00-02.png	January or early February .
m02-048-s01-00.png	Angelina might be a
m02-048-s01-01.png	little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
m02-048-s01-02.png	as arranged , but he consoled himself by
m02-048-s01-03.png	thinking that he and Angelina would have
m02-048-s01-04.png	plenty of time together in the future .
m02-048-s02-00.png	And
m02-048-s02-01.png	Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be
m02-048-s02-02.png	back on Moon again , and able to do
m02-048-s02-03.png	research at first hand into matters on which
m02-048-s02-04.png	the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ...
m02-052-s00-00.png	The recovery of his balance was due to the
m02-052-s00-01.png	fact that he was living , virtually without
m02-052-s00-02.png	expenses , with the people to whom Moke had
m02-052-s00-03.png	sent him : little people who regarded him as
m02-052-s00-04.png	lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes .
m02-052-s01-00.png	Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines in the Secretariat
m02-052-s01-01.png	( Stamp Department ) while Sally sulked at home .
m02-055-s00-00.png	They had been married for six years , but the
m02-055-s00-01.png	salary raise , on the expectation of which they
m02-055-s00-02.png	had done so , had not materialised .
m02-055-s01-00.png	 Do you
m02-055-s01-01.png	know , I had to send back our bedroom
m02-055-s01-02.png	furniture in the second year , she moaned .
m02-055-s02-00.png	She
m02-055-s02-01.png	had contacts in political circles , a school-
m02-055-s02-02.png	friend of hers having married Lester Peron ,
m02-055-s02-03.png	a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
m02-055-s02-04.png	( literally ) all-powerful Rocket Release
m02-055-s02-05.png	Board .
m02-055-s03-00.png	Hostettler
m02-059-s00-00.png	Sometimes she took Harry around with her , but
m02-059-s00-01.png	never her husband , a fact he accepted as inevitable .
m02-059-s01-00.png	 I guess
m02-059-s01-01.png	Sally made a mistake about me , he said one
m02-059-s01-02.png	evening , when he had been left to cook his own meal .
m02-059-s02-00.png	All Sally's relations were 4makrodeb now , but Tom
m02-059-s02-01.png	was a Static Mib , the middle-income-bracket equivalent
m02-059-s02-02.png	to 4sub-lil on the lower .
m02-066-s00-00.png	All Aristotle was excited at the time , not by the prospect of the
m02-066-s00-01.png	U.S. President's visit , but by a great storm in the photo-
m02-066-s00-02.png	sphere of the sun .
m02-066-s01-00.png	A matter which on Earth would hardly
m02-066-s01-01.png	penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
m02-066-s01-02.png	interest to the Mos , doubtless because their habitat is
m02-066-s01-03.png	not submerged beneath a deep natural atmosphere .
m02-069-s00-00.png	One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might
m02-069-s00-01.png	with time instil the reverence which , on Earth , nature inspires ,
m02-069-s00-02.png	especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's
m02-069-s00-03.png	Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the
m02-069-s00-04.png	solar system .
m02-069-s01-00.png	True enough , such ultimate weapons had not been
m02-069-s01-01.png	used in the last few wars , but it seemed very probable
m02-069-s01-02.png	that they would be in the next one , Moon and her
m02-069-s01-03.png	allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the
m02-069-s01-04.png	weapons pronounced conventional .
m02-072-s00-00.png	Lester was not home yet from his formidable
m02-072-s00-01.png	duties and his wife , in the manner of middle-brow
m02-072-s00-02.png	wives , romanced about him in his absence .
m02-072-s01-00.png	 Lester was a
m02-072-s01-01.png	country lawyer , and we were very small 4microdebs , weren't we ,
m02-072-s01-02.png	Sally - here she had dropped her voice in homage to the
m02-072-s01-03.png	economic system : that was reverenced - when he thought
m02-072-s01-04.png	we might get GO a bit better if he entered politics .
m02-075-s00-00.png	Know how he did it ?
m02-075-s01-00.png	He 's clever on
m02-075-s01-01.png	the mouth-organ .
m02-075-s02-00.png	So when he visited some
m02-075-s02-01.png	craterlet on Face ( ours is an agricultural
m02-075-s02-02.png	Back-Face area ) the cry would go up ,
m02-075-s02-03.png	as soon as he had spoken a few
m02-075-s02-04.png	sentences of his speech :
m02-075-s03-00.png	' Cut the
m02-075-s03-01.png	politics , Lester , give us something on
m02-075-s03-02.png	your mouth-organ . '
m02-080-s00-00.png	Sentence Database
m02-080-s01-00.png	That 's how he got the votes , that 's how
m02-080-s01-01.png	we came through to 4makrodeb status and
m02-080-s01-02.png	got all these lovely things - she waved a
m02-080-s01-03.png	plump hand towards her grand pianos , etc :
m02-080-s01-04.png	at the same time a door banged - but don't
m02-080-s01-05.png	say a word about it , Lester wants his
m02-080-s01-06.png	mouth-organ to be forgotten now .
m02-080-s02-00.png	The time
m02-080-s02-01.png	has come for him to be taken seriously
m02-080-s02-02.png	as a statesman . 
m02-083-s00-00.png	Peron entered , a large man , who had once been
m02-083-s00-01.png	handsome but was now seedy-looking , a sufferer
m02-083-s00-02.png	from stomach-ulcers .
m02-083-s01-00.png	In the Back-Face tradition he
m02-083-s01-01.png	wore , and kept on indoors , a fifty gallon hat .
m02-083-s02-00.png	Harry was
m02-083-s02-01.png	prepared for something unpleasant , for this was
m02-083-s02-02.png	the Senator who had annoyed the United States
m02-083-s02-03.png	by bragging how he had once won a trick from
m02-083-s02-04.png	W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his
m02-083-s02-05.png	rockets ( an admission which would scarcely help
m02-083-s02-06.png	bluff to succeed the next time ) and , lately , by
m02-083-s02-07.png	saying that if Mo land-troops had to come to the aid
m02-083-s02-08.png	of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region ,
m02-087-s00-00.png	But privately he turned out to be as friendly as
m02-087-s00-01.png	Mr. Wise the tube manufacturer , to have the same adolescent
m02-087-s00-02.png	openness and freshness , though perhaps not the same
m02-087-s00-03.png	maturity .
m02-087-s01-00.png	One remembered that he was a lawyer
m02-087-s01-01.png	by training , and suspected that the points he made
m02-087-s01-02.png	so sharply in international politics were as abstract
m02-087-s01-03.png	to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
m02-087-s01-04.png	of law .
m02-090-s00-00.png	The motive would be the same in both cases , to
m02-090-s00-01.png	serve this home of his , in which his heart lay .
m02-090-s01-00.png	Here the rocket man's charm was disarming .
m02-090-s02-00.png	Yet
m02-090-s02-01.png	when the time came to leave , Harry felt as de-
m02-090-s02-02.png	pressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office ,
m02-090-s02-03.png	exactly a month ago .
m02-090-s03-00.png	If even Mo statesmen only
m02-090-s03-01.png	did what they had to do to get GO on an expan-
m02-090-s03-02.png	ding scale , and left the sum-total of their actions ,
m02-090-s03-03.png	and their lunar and earthly repercussions , to luck
m02-090-s03-04.png	( or to Moke ) , there was a vacuum where there should
m02-090-s03-05.png	be a centre of trust , responsible for the maintenance
m02-095-s00-00.png	The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
m02-095-s00-01.png	like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
m02-095-s00-02.png	guise which , far from attracting the allegiance
m02-095-s00-03.png	of free men everywhere , could only repel them .
m02-095-s01-00.png	Then what of the cultural life ?
m02-095-s02-00.png	Did this per-
m02-095-s02-01.png	haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
m02-095-s02-02.png	which might in time become social fact
m02-095-s02-03.png	and counteract the obsession with economics
m02-095-s02-04.png	which had grown up during the Moon's
m02-095-s02-05.png	first two centuries ?
m02-102-s00-00.png	At the centre of each circle stood personnel
m02-102-s00-01.png	managers of corporations , together with professors
m02-102-s00-02.png	and their filing clerks .
m02-102-s01-00.png	The students had
m02-102-s01-01.png	bought their college education forward and
m02-102-s01-02.png	were now being bought forward in their
m02-102-s01-03.png	turn .
m02-102-s02-00.png	By comparing personal appearances
m02-102-s02-01.png	with university records , the agents of the
m02-102-s02-02.png	businesses would pick on young men
m02-102-s02-03.png	and women who interested them , and contracts
m02-102-s02-04.png	would be initialled at the end of
m02-102-s02-05.png	the parade .
m02-106-s00-00.png	But since starting salaries would depend on grade A
m02-106-s00-01.png	or B in the finals next May , and since mating
m02-106-s00-02.png	prospects would depend upon salaries , scholarship for
m02-106-s00-03.png	these fine young people was closely geared to
m02-106-s00-04.png	economic and biological ends which , essentially ,
m02-106-s00-05.png	were really means .
m02-106-s01-00.png	So , seeing them revolve in
m02-106-s01-01.png	circles , Harry had the feeling that Moke ( or what
m02-106-s01-02.png	Moke consciously or unconsciously symbolised , any-
m02-106-s01-03.png	way in Harry's mind ) had these splendid young
m02-106-s01-04.png	people by the short hairs , and was diverting them ...
m02-109-s00-00.png	Stepping out in their white shorts , they looked glad enough
m02-109-s00-01.png	to be diverted , however , with the single exception of one
m02-109-s00-02.png	worried little man-student who kept getting out of
m02-109-s00-03.png	step .
m02-109-s01-00.png	He looked as if nothing Moke and his
m02-109-s01-01.png	minions could do to him would ever make him
m02-109-s01-02.png	GO ; but the reason probably lay in elementary
m02-109-s01-03.png	neurosis and not in some eruption from those
m02-109-s01-04.png	deeper layers in the human psyche which are
m02-109-s01-05.png	trans-economic .
m02-112-s00-00.png	So once again the metaphysics were depressing ,
m02-112-s00-01.png	and in absolute contrast to the physical display .
m02-112-s01-00.png	Mos have an un-American love of parades , and
m02-112-s01-01.png	these young ones , on parade for jobs which they
m02-112-s01-02.png	had to get to pay off their college bills , were naturally
m02-112-s01-03.png	putting their best foot forward .
m03-006-s00-00.png	' Something 's up , ' said Lord Undertone ,
m03-006-s00-01.png	carefully casual .
m03-006-s01-00.png	' The servants are all on
m03-006-s01-01.png	edge ... did you notice ?
m03-006-s02-00.png	And the mules
m03-006-s02-01.png	didn't seem to want to get off the raft . '
m03-006-s03-00.png	He peered as it were into the dark secrets
m03-006-s03-01.png	of the jungle .
m03-006-s04-00.png	' Think there 's Indians
m03-006-s04-01.png	about ? '
m03-006-s05-00.png	It was most certainly an eerie
m03-006-s05-01.png	night , exceptionally brilliant and strange ,
m03-006-s05-02.png	for in the proximity of the mountains ,
m03-006-s05-03.png	whose presence I could almost smell ,
m03-013-s00-00.png	' Impressive , ' Lord Undertone said , gazing reverently
m03-013-s00-01.png	on the cosmic handiwork .
m03-013-s01-00.png	' All those stars .
m03-013-s02-00.png	But I 'm
m03-013-s02-01.png	a bit earthbound tonight , Trout .
m03-013-s03-00.png	I 've got a queer
m03-013-s03-01.png	feeling , like I always get when something
m03-013-s03-02.png	sensational 's going to happen .
m03-013-s04-00.png	There 's things lurking
m03-013-s04-01.png	if you ask me .
m03-013-s05-00.png	Might be jaguar , might be ...
m03-013-s05-01.png	head-shrinkers .
m03-020-s00-00.png	Hope I die kind of composed , Trout .
m03-020-s01-00.png	I mean you can't
m03-020-s01-01.png	imagine the Christian martyrs twisting and shrieking ,
m03-020-s01-02.png	no matter how bad it felt , the fire you know , or a
m03-020-s01-03.png	lion munching , or arrows where it hurts most .
m03-020-s02-00.png	Or
m03-020-s02-01.png	can you .
m03-020-s03-00.png	Look over there . '
m03-020-s04-00.png	He pointed to the
m03-020-s04-01.png	shadows beyond the river .
m03-020-s05-00.png	' Something moved . '
m03-033-s00-00.png	' Bottle-Foot , my lord . '
m03-033-s01-00.png	' Bottle-Foot ? '
m03-033-s02-00.png	His lordship
m03-033-s02-01.png	may have thought I had become unbalanced
m03-033-s02-02.png	through fear .
m03-033-s03-00.png	' A character Mr Gilberto mentioned
m03-033-s03-01.png	to other day , my lord .
m03-033-s04-00.png	A being of whom
m03-033-s04-01.png	the forest Indians are said to be mortally
m03-033-s04-02.png	afraid , with a hoof shaped like the heel
m03-033-s04-03.png	of a bottle .
m03-033-s05-00.png	If your lordship will excuse me
m03-033-s05-01.png	a moment ... '
m03-062-s00-00.png	Small , repulsive creatures they were ,
m03-062-s00-01.png	with black , matted hair and a striking
m03-062-s00-02.png	resemblance to the shrunk heads we had
m03-062-s00-03.png	gazed at recently ; and I have no
m03-062-s00-04.png	hesitation in saying that they would have
m03-062-s00-05.png	made an end of us but for an intervention
m03-062-s00-06.png	so unexpected , so unusual , that only the
m03-062-s00-07.png	necessity of rounding my narrative
m03-062-s00-08.png	compels me to mention it .
m03-095-s00-00.png	I had a distinct impression that the
m03-095-s00-01.png	hut had recently been cleaned and
m03-095-s00-02.png	prepared for visitors .
m03-095-s01-00.png	Mrs Caine said
m03-095-s01-01.png	we were to go no further unless and
m03-095-s01-02.png	until we were sent for , confirming
m03-095-s01-03.png	another impression that became more
m03-095-s01-04.png	and more definite , namely , that
m03-095-s01-05.png	she was in touch with an invi-
m03-095-s01-06.png	sible source of authority .
m03-110-s00-00.png	Sally and of course Mrs Septimus , for surely
m03-110-s00-01.png	Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
m03-110-s00-02.png	myself ?
m03-110-s01-00.png	But was it so ?
m03-110-s02-00.png	I allowed myself
m03-110-s02-01.png	to entertain for an instant the idea , the
m03-110-s02-02.png	strange , the unwelcome , the almost
m03-110-s02-03.png	inconceivable idea , that Ariadne's arrival
m03-110-s02-04.png	would be inopportune ; and with the idea came
m03-110-s02-05.png	a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused ,
m03-110-s02-06.png	to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs
m03-110-s02-07.png	Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
m03-114-s00-00.png	But all three were to the casual
m03-114-s00-01.png	observation I permitted myself unruffled ;
m03-114-s00-02.png	Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
m03-114-s00-03.png	thoughtful , but that was his habit .
m03-114-s01-00.png	Indeed
m03-114-s01-01.png	we were all invaded by a most tranquil
m03-114-s01-02.png	mood .
m03-114-s02-00.png	Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,
m03-114-s02-01.png	so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and
m03-114-s02-02.png	savage tribes never approached this region : at
m03-114-s02-03.png	any rate they remained with us , perhaps
m03-114-s02-04.png	for such protection as our presence , or Mrs
m03-118-s00-00.png	But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
m03-118-s00-01.png	far from our minds that at any moment we were
m03-118-s00-02.png	to receive a summons .
m03-118-s01-00.png	I could see that Mr Septimus
m03-118-s01-01.png	was impatient for it .
m03-118-s02-00.png	This afternoon , then , we climbed
m03-118-s02-01.png	a promontory , a mass of clean rock crowned with
m03-118-s02-02.png	trees and bushes , that stood well out over the lake .
m04-000-s00-00.png	NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a
m04-000-s00-01.png	single-decker Welsh bus could have got
m04-000-s00-02.png	itself into orbit .
m04-000-s01-00.png	Shooting up over the pass a bit
m04-000-s01-01.png	too carefree , and becoming airborne ?
m04-000-s02-00.png	Caught by a sudden gust of wind ?
m04-000-s03-00.png	A
m04-000-s03-01.png	combination of the two ?
m04-000-s04-00.png	No one seems
m04-000-s04-01.png	to know .
m04-000-s05-00.png	But the fact remains that get
m04-000-s05-01.png	itself into orbit it did .
m04-007-s00-00.png	And a fine old fuss there was about it , too .
m04-007-s01-00.png	Here are the known facts .
m04-007-s02-00.png	On 10th July ,
m04-007-s02-01.png	the bus , the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl ,
m04-007-s02-02.png	left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual .
m04-007-s03-00.png	Aboard , apart from the crew , were Mrs. Megan
m04-007-s03-01.png	Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader ;
m04-007-s03-02.png	pretty little Morfydd Owen ; Mr. Stanley Hayball
m04-007-s03-03.png	and Miss Ethel Yates , hikers from
m04-007-s03-04.png	Birmingham ; Price the Provisions ; and the
m04-007-s03-05.png	Rev. Edwards .
m04-012-s00-00.png	Yes , the bus set out from Dinas .
m04-012-s01-00.png	So much
m04-012-s01-01.png	is established .
m04-012-s02-00.png	Ifor Huw Evans , Propr. ,
m04-012-s02-01.png	watched it go from the windows of the
m04-012-s02-02.png	Dinas Motor Omnibus Co.
m04-012-s03-00.png	Very interested ,
m04-012-s03-01.png	Ifor was .
m04-012-s04-00.png	For there was his garage hand ,
m04-012-s04-01.png	Dai Pugh , taking a tearful farewell of
m04-012-s04-02.png	Morfydd Owen .
m04-012-s05-00.png	Morfydd , who had until
m04-012-s05-01.png	recently been Ifor's typist , but was now
m04-012-s05-02.png	returning to her home town as a
m04-012-s05-03.png	fully-fledged schoolteacher .
m04-019-s00-00.png	 But I 'm only going fifteen miles away , 
m04-019-s00-01.png	Morfydd was saying .
m04-019-s01-00.png	 Not the end of
m04-019-s01-01.png	the world , is it ? 
m04-019-s02-00.png	 For me it is , Dai
m04-019-s02-01.png	said wretchedly , wiping his hands on his
m04-019-s02-02.png	overalls preparatory to a last embrace .
m04-019-s03-00.png	 You
m04-019-s03-01.png	will not be remembering a mere garage
m04-019-s03-02.png	hand when you are lording it over
m04-019-s03-03.png	the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl . 
m04-024-s00-00.png	 Silly boy , said Morfydd .
m04-024-s01-00.png	Though she
m04-024-s01-01.png	could not help wondering whether , now she
m04-024-s01-02.png	had qualified as a schoolteacher , poor
m04-024-s01-03.png	little Dai was quite the man for her .
m04-024-s02-00.png	A nice boy of course .
m04-024-s03-00.png	But perhaps in the
m04-024-s03-01.png	new world she was entering there might
m04-024-s03-02.png	be boys equally nice , and with far more
m04-024-s03-03.png	to offer .
m04-024-s04-00.png	The conductor rang his bell .
m04-030-s00-00.png	 Good-bye , Dai , said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step .
m04-030-s01-00.png	 Good-bye , Morfydd . 
m04-030-s02-00.png	He sought to enfold her in his arms .
m04-030-s03-00.png	But he was too late .
m04-030-s04-00.png	She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away .
m04-030-s05-00.png	And Morfydd Owen
m04-030-s05-01.png	waving , unkissed , from the window .
m04-030-s06-00.png	And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his
m04-030-s06-01.png	heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas .
m04-038-s00-00.png	So the bus set out for Llangrwl .
m04-038-s01-00.png	But it never reached there !
m04-038-s02-00.png	Somewhere ,
m04-038-s02-01.png	on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly
m04-038-s02-02.png	scene .
m04-038-s03-00.png	The first intimation that all was not well came when a
m04-038-s03-01.png	Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller's Joy , rang up the
m04-038-s03-02.png	Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
m04-038-s03-03.png	damn bus .
m04-043-s00-00.png	 Left here all right , said Ifor .
m04-043-s01-00.png	 Two-thirty-five , on the dot . 
m04-043-s02-00.png	 It 's
m04-043-s02-01.png	supposed to leave at two-twenty . 
m04-043-s03-00.png	 Who says so ? 
m04-043-s04-00.png	 Your timetable . 
m04-043-s05-00.png	 Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables , Ifor said ,
m04-043-s05-01.png	reasonably .
m04-043-s06-00.png	 Start running punctual and where are you ?
m04-043-s07-00.png	People get
m04-043-s07-01.png	left behind , isn't it ?
m04-043-s08-00.png	Very exasperating for one and all . 
m04-061-s00-00.png	 And what are you going to do about it ? 
m04-061-s01-00.png	Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded .
m04-061-s02-00.png	 What do you want me to do ?
m04-061-s03-00.png	Send out a sheriff's posse , is it ? 
m04-061-s04-00.png	No sense
m04-061-s04-01.png	of humour , that Isaiah .
m04-061-s05-00.png	He banged down the receiver .
m04-061-s06-00.png	Very uncivil .
m04-061-s07-00.png	Dropped
m04-061-s07-01.png	the mask , now , Ifor did .
m04-061-s08-00.png	 Dai Pugh , he bellowed .
m04-061-s09-00.png	 Leap on your bicycle
m04-061-s09-01.png	and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy .
m04-072-s00-00.png	The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
m04-072-s00-01.png	complete her mission . 
m04-072-s01-00.png	Paled , did Dai .
m04-072-s02-00.png	For the
m04-072-s02-01.png	two-twenty carried , for him , a cargo more
m04-072-s02-02.png	precious than jewels .
m04-072-s03-00.png	Though Mofydd Owen
m04-072-s03-01.png	was , as he feared , departed out of his life ,
m04-072-s03-02.png	he still loved her dearly .
m04-072-s04-00.png	Already , even
m04-072-s04-01.png	as with trembling fingers he fastened his
m04-072-s04-02.png	trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in
m04-072-s04-03.png	some dreadful ravine , or beset by
m04-072-s04-04.png	robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency
m04-072-s04-05.png	Ward 10 .
m04-078-s00-00.png	But even his imagination , luckily for him ,
m04-078-s00-01.png	did not visualise the awful truth - that
m04-078-s00-02.png	Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
m04-078-s00-03.png	the title of First Woman to Enter Space . 
m04-078-s01-00.png	 Where are we going , Mam ? inquired little
m04-078-s01-01.png	Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
m04-078-s01-02.png	the fact that the green earth was falling
m04-078-s01-03.png	away at a rate of knots .
m04-081-s00-00.png	Where indeed ?
m04-081-s01-00.png	Megan Thomas spoke sharply
m04-081-s01-01.png	to the conductor , demanding an explanation .
m04-081-s02-00.png	But nonplussed , the conductor was .
m04-081-s03-00.png	A
m04-081-s03-01.png	good man , mind ; knew his job .
m04-081-s04-00.png	But out of
m04-081-s04-01.png	depth in this particular instance .
m04-081-s05-00.png	Fingered
m04-081-s05-01.png	his ticket-punch nervously .
m04-081-s06-00.png	Peered out of
m04-081-s06-01.png	the window .
m04-081-s07-00.png	Went and consulted the driver .
m04-081-s08-00.png	 Where are we going ? he echoed Cadwallader .
m04-081-s09-00.png	 Damned if I know , boy , said the driver .
m04-081-s10-00.png	 But something very untoward has
m04-081-s10-01.png	happened , if you ask me . 
m04-093-s00-00.png	Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser , was the
m04-093-s00-01.png	Rev. Edwards .
m04-093-s01-00.png	Now he put down his paper ,
m04-093-s01-01.png	folded it , and glanced idly out of the
m04-093-s01-02.png	window .
m04-093-s02-00.png	Looked again , eyes starting from
m04-093-s02-01.png	his head .
m04-093-s03-00.png	 God bless my immortal soul , 
m04-093-s03-01.png	he cried .
m04-093-s04-00.png	 Never mind your immortal
m04-093-s04-01.png	soul , said Megan Thomas tartly .
m04-093-s05-00.png	 Here we are traversing the heavens at the
m04-093-s05-01.png	very moment when we should be
m04-093-s05-02.png	running into Llangrwl bus station .
m04-100-s00-00.png	And no one doing the first thing about
m04-100-s00-01.png	it . 
m04-100-s01-00.png	Stung , the conductor was .
m04-100-s02-00.png	 What you
m04-100-s02-01.png	expect me to do ? he inquired , bitter .
m04-100-s03-00.png	 Radio Flying Control at London Airport ,
m04-100-s03-01.png	is it ? 
m04-100-s04-00.png	 Mutual recriminations will get
m04-100-s04-01.png	us nowhere , boomed the Rev. Edwards .
m04-100-s05-00.png	 It 's all very well , commented
m04-100-s05-01.png	Mr. Hayball from the back seat .
m04-107-s00-00.png	 But Eth and me wanted to be
m04-107-s00-01.png	at the Youth Hostel before dark . 
m04-107-s01-00.png	Morfydd Owen was silent .
m04-107-s02-00.png	But she
m04-107-s02-01.png	looked down at the fast-disappearing
m04-107-s02-02.png	earth , and it seemed to her that she
m04-107-s02-03.png	would never see her Dai again .
m04-107-s03-00.png	And
m04-107-s03-01.png	though half an hour ago she had
m04-107-s03-02.png	regarded this possibility with
m04-107-s03-03.png	fortitude , it now filled her with
m04-107-s03-04.png	dismay .
m04-107-s04-00.png	Quietly she began to
m04-107-s04-01.png	weep ...
m04-113-s00-00.png	Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling
m04-113-s00-01.png	furiously on the road .
m04-113-s01-00.png	Not a sign of
m04-113-s01-01.png	the bus .
m04-113-s02-00.png	He passed The Traveller's
m04-113-s02-01.png	Joy .
m04-113-s03-00.png	At last he caught up Mr. Roberts ,
m04-113-s03-01.png	walking very dogged towards Llangrwl .
m04-113-s04-00.png	 Afternoon , Mr. Roberts , he called , polite ,
m04-113-s04-01.png	as he shot past .
m04-113-s05-00.png	His spirits were rising .
m04-113-s06-00.png	He had seen no sign of an accident .
m04-113-s07-00.png	Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken .
m04-113-s08-00.png	He would find the bus safe and sound in
m04-113-s08-01.png	Llangrwl , and his dear Morfydd quietly
m04-123-s00-00.png	But disappointment awaited him .
m04-123-s01-00.png	A
m04-123-s01-01.png	restive queue of people in the bus station ,
m04-123-s01-02.png	waiting to be transported to Dinas .
m04-123-s02-00.png	And
m04-123-s02-01.png	when he went to Morfydd's house , all
m04-123-s02-02.png	he found was Morfydd's mam , working
m04-123-s02-03.png	herself up proper ...
m04-123-s03-00.png	Getting dark , now .
m04-123-s04-00.png	The conductor switched on the lights .
m04-123-s05-00.png	The beleaguered passengers peered out of
m04-123-s05-01.png	the windows .
m04-123-s06-00.png	Little to be seen , only a
m04-123-s06-01.png	few lone stars , and the distant earth
m04-123-s06-02.png	brooding in her shroud of mist .
m04-131-s00-00.png	Megan Thomas sat tight-lipped , nursing
m04-131-s00-01.png	the sleeping Cadwallader .
m04-131-s01-00.png	Driver and
m04-131-s01-01.png	conductor peered ahead into nothingness .
m04-131-s02-00.png	On the back seat Stan Hayball embraced
m04-131-s02-01.png	his Eth .
m04-131-s03-00.png	Morfydd thought of Dai .
m04-131-s04-00.png	The
m04-131-s04-01.png	Rev. Edwards , standing at the front ,
m04-131-s04-02.png	looked at his forlorn flock .
m04-131-s05-00.png	 What
m04-131-s05-01.png	about a verse or two of Cwm Rhondda ? 
m04-131-s05-02.png	he suggested hopefully .
m04-138-s00-00.png	They looked at him , sullen .
m04-138-s01-00.png	His heart
m04-138-s01-01.png	sank .
m04-138-s02-00.png	If the Welsh found the situation
m04-138-s02-01.png	too desperate for singing , then the
m04-138-s02-02.png	situation , he realised , must be desperate
m04-138-s02-03.png	indeed .
m04-138-s03-00.png	But suddenly they were roused
m04-138-s03-01.png	from their lethargy .
m04-138-s04-00.png	Something was
m04-138-s04-01.png	approaching , faster , faster , a tearing
m04-138-s04-02.png	hurrying blur that was past and gone
m04-138-s04-03.png	in a moment , followed by a great
m04-138-s04-04.png	rush of sound .
m04-138-s05-00.png	They waved frantically .
m04-145-s00-00.png	But the jet aircraft was already miles away ,
m04-145-s00-01.png	swinging down to the darkening earth .
m04-145-s01-00.png	 It
m04-145-s01-01.png	passed me at fifty thousand feet , sir .
m04-145-s02-00.png	It was
m04-145-s02-01.png	climbing steadily . 
m04-145-s03-00.png	Group Captain Llewelyn Jones , Officer
m04-145-s03-01.png	Commanding R.A.F. Station , Dinas , looked keenly at the
m04-145-s03-02.png	Flying Officer who had burst so unceremoniously into his
m04-145-s03-03.png	office .
m04-145-s04-00.png	 And what did it look like , Broughtons ?
m04-145-s05-00.png	Some
m04-145-s05-01.png	sort of rocket ? 
m04-152-s00-00.png	Flying Officer Broughtons shuffled his feet .
m04-152-s01-00.png	 Well , actually , sir , it looked like - like a bus .
m04-152-s02-00.png	A single-decker , he elaborated .
m04-152-s03-00.png	Daggers , the
m04-152-s03-01.png	Group Captain looked .
m04-152-s04-00.png	 Broughtons , he said silkily .
m04-152-s05-00.png	 Didn't they teach you at Cranwell that buses are
m04-152-s05-01.png	earth-bound creatures ?
m04-152-s06-00.png	Aeroplanes fly , Broughtons .
m04-152-s07-00.png	Buses crawl . 
m04-152-s08-00.png	Very pale , Broughtons was .
m04-152-s09-00.png	But
m04-152-s09-01.png	determined .
m04-152-s10-00.png	 It was a bus , sir .
m04-164-s00-00.png	They 'd got the lights on .
m04-164-s01-00.png	There were people inside .
m04-164-s02-00.png	Waving . 
m04-164-s03-00.png	Like gimlets , the Station Commander's eyes .
m04-164-s04-00.png	 Did you see the indicator board ? 
m04-164-s05-00.png	 Yes , sir . 
m04-164-s06-00.png	 And
m04-164-s06-01.png	what did it say ?
m04-164-s07-00.png	Mystery Tour ? 
m04-164-s08-00.png	Oh , very caustic , that
m04-164-s08-01.png	Group Captain .
m04-164-s09-00.png	But Broughtons stood his ground .
m04-164-s10-00.png	 No ,
m04-164-s10-01.png	sir .
m04-164-s11-00.png	It said Llangrwl . 
m04-164-s12-00.png	Llewelyn Jones sat
m04-164-s12-01.png	back in his chair .
m04-164-s13-00.png	 I see .
m04-164-s14-00.png	So you met a bus at
m04-164-s14-01.png	fifty thousand feet .
m04-180-s00-00.png	All lit up .
m04-180-s01-00.png	Full of people waving as you went past . 
m04-180-s02-00.png	Suddenly he crouched forward .
m04-180-s03-00.png	 Broughtons , if I thought
m04-180-s03-01.png	there were anything in Queen's Regulations to cover this ,
m04-180-s03-02.png	I 'd have you court-martialled .
m04-180-s04-00.png	But I know there
m04-180-s04-01.png	isn't , he ended sadly .
m04-180-s05-00.png	 I tried to read the
m04-180-s05-01.png	registration number , sir .
m04-180-s06-00.png	But it was getting dark . 
m04-180-s07-00.png	He waited .
m04-180-s08-00.png	But his commanding officer appeared to
m04-180-s08-01.png	have forgotten him .
m04-190-s00-00.png	He saluted , and left the presence , very crestfallen ...
m04-190-s01-00.png	Time passed .
m04-190-s02-00.png	The bus climbed , and went quietly
m04-190-s02-01.png	into orbit .
m04-190-s03-00.png	Time passed .
m04-190-s04-00.png	The Rev. Edwards' pulpit
m04-190-s04-01.png	remained empty .
m04-190-s05-00.png	And so did the arms of Dai
m04-190-s05-01.png	Pugh .
m04-190-s06-00.png	How could they be otherwise , when his
m04-190-s06-01.png	beloved was circling the Poles at three-and-a-
m04-190-s06-02.png	quarter-hour intervals , regular as clockwork ?
m04-190-s07-00.png	Time passed .
m04-190-s08-00.png	Everyone said , Pity about Megan
m04-190-s08-01.png	Thomas , isn't it , as though they didn't really think
m04-190-s08-02.png	it was a pity at all ; as , indeed , they didn't .
m04-200-s00-00.png	LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS announced the
m04-200-s00-01.png	Dinas Advertiser .
m04-200-s01-00.png	But the London papers ignored
m04-200-s01-01.png	the whole affair .
m04-200-s02-00.png	Ifor Evans reported his loss
m04-200-s02-01.png	to the police .
m04-200-s03-00.png	But they only tut-tutted .
m04-200-s04-00.png	 Lost
m04-200-s04-01.png	a bus , is it .
m04-200-s05-00.png	Very careless . 
m04-200-s06-00.png	That was their
m04-200-s06-01.png	attitude .
m04-200-s07-00.png	Now if there 'd been a good old accident ,
m04-200-s07-01.png	they could have measured up the road and
m04-200-s07-02.png	taken an interest .
m04-209-s00-00.png	But losing a bus !
m04-209-s01-00.png	People were always losing
m04-209-s01-01.png	things .
m04-209-s02-00.png	You 'd be surprised , they said .
m04-209-s03-00.png	So it
m04-209-s03-01.png	seemed , for a time , that the whole affair would
m04-209-s03-02.png	be written off as one of those unexplained
m04-209-s03-03.png	mysteries , like the Marie Celeste .
m04-209-s04-00.png	Then things
m04-209-s04-01.png	began to happen ...
m04-209-s05-00.png	But what about the voyagers ?
m04-209-s05-01.png	you will be asking .
m04-216-s00-00.png	Well , the Rev. Edwards had taken command .
m04-216-s01-00.png	 Our
m04-216-s01-01.png	position , he said , is somewhat analogous to
m04-216-s01-02.png	that of a castaway on a desert island .
m04-216-s02-00.png	Now
m04-216-s02-01.png	what does such a person do ?
m04-216-s03-00.png	He signals
m04-216-s03-01.png	his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a
m04-216-s03-02.png	flag on a palm tree .
m04-216-s04-00.png	And he tries to ensure
m04-216-s04-01.png	a supply of food . 
m04-222-s00-00.png	 Can't go lighting bonfires on this bus , 
m04-222-s00-01.png	the conductor said firmly .
m04-222-s01-00.png	 Contrary to the
m04-222-s01-01.png	Company's Regulations . 
m04-222-s02-00.png	 Of course not , agreed
m04-222-s02-01.png	the minister .
m04-222-s03-00.png	 No , we have another way of signalling
m04-222-s03-01.png	our position .
m04-222-s04-00.png	The driver must sound his horn
m04-222-s04-01.png	continuously . 
m04-222-s05-00.png	Gave him a look , the driver did .
m04-222-s06-00.png	 Where you think we are ? he asked rudely .
m04-222-s07-00.png	 Dinas High Street ? 
m04-231-s00-00.png	 Do as I say , driver . 
m04-231-s01-00.png	Very stern , the reverend
m04-231-s01-01.png	gentleman was .
m04-231-s02-00.png	So the driver peep-peeped as
m04-231-s02-01.png	through empty space .
m04-231-s03-00.png	 Thank you , the Rev.
m04-231-s03-01.png	Edwards said courteously .
m04-231-s04-00.png	 Secondly , we must
m04-231-s04-01.png	pool and ration our supplies of food , if any . 
m04-231-s05-00.png	He looked at Price the Provisions , who was nursing
m04-231-s05-01.png	a great basket .
m04-238-s00-00.png	 Now , who has any food ? he asked hopefully .
m04-238-s01-00.png	Stared back did Price the Provisions , unwinking .
m04-238-s02-00.png	 Mr. Price , I think you may be able to help us here , 
m04-238-s02-01.png	said the Rev. Edwards .
m04-238-s03-00.png	Price shook his head .
m04-238-s04-00.png	 Intended for Plas Newydd , this lot is .
m04-238-s05-00.png	Paid for ,
m04-238-s05-01.png	too . 
m04-238-s06-00.png	He folded his arms protectively over the basket .
m04-246-s00-00.png	Mutinous dog , thought the Rev. Edwards , who hadn't
m04-246-s00-01.png	enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure
m04-246-s00-02.png	Island .
m04-246-s01-00.png	 What have you got in that basket , Price ? 
m04-246-s01-01.png	he roared .
m04-246-s02-00.png	Quelled , Mr. Price pulled out a grocery
m04-246-s02-01.png	list , pushed his glasses up on his nose , and
m04-246-s02-02.png	began to read .
m04-246-s03-00.png	 Six loaves , four pounds butter ,
m04-246-s03-01.png	two pounds marge , one tin pineapple , one York ham . 
m04-251-s00-00.png	 Then we are saved , cried the Rev. Edwards .
m04-251-s01-00.png	Shyly , Morfydd Owen produced a block of
m04-251-s01-01.png	chocolate .
m06-019-s00-00.png	Though your wings and your scars are new ,
m06-019-s00-01.png	you may join us . '
m06-019-s01-00.png	' I am Lily-yo .
m06-019-s02-00.png	We three
m06-019-s02-01.png	are humans .
m06-019-s03-00.png	You are only flymen .
m06-019-s04-00.png	We will
m06-019-s04-01.png	not join you . '
m06-019-s05-00.png	The Captives grunted in boredom .
m06-019-s06-00.png	The Chief Captive spoke again .
m06-019-s07-00.png	' Always this
m06-019-s07-01.png	talk from you of the Heavy World !
m06-019-s08-00.png	You have
m06-019-s08-01.png	joined us .
m06-019-s09-00.png	You are flymen , we are human .
m06-019-s10-00.png	You
m06-019-s10-01.png	know little , we know much . '
m06-031-s00-00.png	' But we - '
m06-031-s01-00.png	' Stop your stupid talk , woman ! '
m06-031-s02-00.png	' We are - '
m06-031-s03-00.png	' Be silent , woman , and listen , ' Band Appa Bondi said .
m06-031-s04-00.png	' We know much , ' repeated the Chief Captive .
m06-031-s05-00.png	' Some
m06-031-s05-01.png	things we will tell you .
m06-031-s06-00.png	All who make the journey from
m06-031-s06-01.png	the Heavy World become changed .
m06-031-s07-00.png	Some die .
m06-031-s08-00.png	Most live
m06-031-s08-01.png	and grow wings .
m06-031-s09-00.png	Between the worlds are many strong
m06-031-s09-01.png	rays , not seen or felt , which change our bodies .
m06-042-s00-00.png	When you come here , when you come to the True
m06-042-s00-01.png	World , you become a true human .
m06-042-s01-00.png	The grub of the
m06-042-s01-01.png	tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes .
m06-042-s02-00.png	So humans
m06-042-s02-01.png	change . '
m06-042-s03-00.png	' I cannot know what he says , ' Haris said
m06-042-s03-01.png	stubbornly , throwing himself down .
m06-042-s04-00.png	But Lily-yo and
m06-042-s04-01.png	Flor were listening .
m06-048-s00-00.png	' To this True World , as you call it , we come to die , '
m06-048-s00-01.png	Lily-yo said , doubtingly .
m06-048-s01-00.png	The Captive with the
m06-048-s01-01.png	fleshless jaw said , ' The grub of the tigerfly thinks
m06-048-s01-02.png	it dies when it changes into a tigerfly . '
m06-048-s02-00.png	' You are still
m06-048-s02-01.png	young , ' said the Chief Captive .
m06-048-s03-00.png	' You begin newly here .
m06-048-s04-00.png	Where are your souls ? '
m06-048-s05-00.png	Lily-yo and Flor looked at
m06-048-s05-01.png	each other .
m06-048-s06-00.png	In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
m06-048-s06-01.png	heedlessly thrown down their souls .
m06-056-s00-00.png	Haris had trampled on his .
m06-056-s01-00.png	It was unthinkable !
m06-056-s02-00.png	' You see .
m06-056-s03-00.png	You needed them no more .
m06-056-s04-00.png	You are still
m06-056-s04-01.png	young .
m06-056-s05-00.png	You may be able to have babies .
m06-056-s06-00.png	Some of those
m06-056-s06-01.png	babies may be born with wings . '
m06-056-s07-00.png	The Captive with
m06-056-s07-01.png	the boneless arms added ,
m06-056-s08-00.png	' Some may be born wrong ,
m06-056-s08-01.png	as we are .
m06-056-s09-00.png	Some may be born right . '
m06-067-s00-00.png	' You are too foul to live ! ' Haris growled .
m06-067-s01-00.png	' Why are
m06-067-s01-01.png	you not killed ? '
m06-067-s02-00.png	' Because we know all things , ' the
m06-067-s02-01.png	Chief Captive said .
m06-067-s03-00.png	Suddenly his second head roused
m06-067-s03-01.png	itself and declared ,
m06-067-s04-00.png	' To be a good shape is not all
m06-067-s04-01.png	in life .
m06-067-s05-00.png	To know is also good .
m06-067-s06-00.png	Because we cannot move
m06-067-s06-01.png	well we can - think .
m06-067-s07-00.png	This tribe of the True World
m06-067-s07-01.png	is good and knows these things .
m06-076-s00-00.png	So it lets us rule it . '
m06-076-s01-00.png	Flor and Lily-yo
m06-076-s01-01.png	muttered together .
m06-076-s02-00.png	' Do you say that you poor
m06-076-s02-01.png	Captives rule the True World ? ' Lily-yo asked
m06-076-s02-02.png	at last .
m06-076-s03-00.png	' We do . '
m06-076-s04-00.png	' Then why are you captives ? '
m06-076-s05-00.png	The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected ,
m06-076-s05-01.png	making his perpetual little gesture of protest ,
m06-076-s05-02.png	spoke for the first time .
m06-083-s00-00.png	' To rule is to serve , woman .
m06-083-s01-00.png	Those who bear power
m06-083-s01-01.png	are slaves to it .
m06-083-s02-00.png	Only an outcast is free .
m06-083-s03-00.png	Because
m06-083-s03-01.png	we are Captives , we have the time to talk and
m06-083-s03-02.png	think and plan and know .
m06-083-s04-00.png	Those who know
m06-083-s04-01.png	command the knives of others . '
m06-083-s05-00.png	' No hurt will
m06-083-s05-01.png	come to you , Lily-yo , ' Band Appa Bondi added .
m06-083-s06-00.png	' You will live among us and enjoy your life free
m06-083-s06-01.png	from harm . '
m06-091-s00-00.png	' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths .
m06-091-s01-00.png	' Before she can enjoy , Lily-yo and her companion
m06-091-s01-01.png	Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
m06-091-s01-02.png	must help our great plan . '
m06-091-s02-00.png	' The invasion ? ' Bondi
m06-091-s02-01.png	asked .
m06-091-s03-00.png	' What else ?
m06-091-s04-00.png	Flor and Lily-yo , you arrive
m06-091-s04-01.png	here at a good time .
m06-091-s05-00.png	Memories of the Heavy World
m06-091-s05-01.png	and its savage life are still fresh in you .
m06-098-s00-00.png	We need such memories .
m06-098-s01-00.png	So we ask you to go
m06-098-s01-01.png	back there on a great plan we have . '
m06-098-s02-00.png	' Go back ? '
m06-098-s02-01.png	gasped Flor .
m06-098-s03-00.png	' Yes .
m06-098-s04-00.png	We plan to attack the Heavy
m06-098-s04-01.png	World .
m06-098-s05-00.png	You must help to lead our force . '
m06-098-s06-00.png	The long
m06-098-s06-01.png	afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road
m06-098-s06-02.png	of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
m06-098-s06-03.png	everlasting night .
m06-106-s00-00.png	Motion there was , but motion without event - except
m06-106-s00-01.png	for those negligible events that seemed so large to
m06-106-s00-02.png	the creatures participating in them .
m06-106-s01-00.png	For Lily-yo , Flor
m06-106-s01-01.png	and Haris there were many events .
m06-106-s02-00.png	Chief of these was
m06-106-s02-01.png	that they learned to fly properly .
m06-106-s03-00.png	The pains associated
m06-106-s03-01.png	with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
m06-106-s03-02.png	new flesh and tendon strengthened .
m06-106-s04-00.png	To sail up in the
m06-106-s04-01.png	light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
m06-106-s04-02.png	flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
m06-106-s04-03.png	had no place here .
n01-000-s00-00.png	Alastair was a bachelor .
n01-000-s01-00.png	All his life he had
n01-000-s01-01.png	been inclined to regard women as something
n01-000-s01-02.png	which must necessarily be subordinated to his
n01-000-s01-03.png	career .
n01-000-s02-00.png	Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
n01-000-s02-01.png	his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl
n01-000-s02-02.png	whom he had never met and on whom after no more
n01-000-s02-03.png	than a couple of telephone calls he was
n01-000-s02-04.png	prepared to place complete reliance .
n01-004-s00-00.png	It was a novel experience .
n01-004-s01-00.png	Alastair was
n01-004-s01-01.png	quite unable to explain why he should feel
n01-004-s01-02.png	so much confidence in her .
n01-004-s02-00.png	Once again
n01-004-s02-01.png	she checked back her instructions .
n01-004-s03-00.png	It was
n01-004-s03-01.png	obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
n01-004-s03-02.png	faith which he was placing in her and
n01-004-s03-03.png	was prepared to accept the responsibility .
n01-009-s00-00.png	 Good luck , Air Marshal , she said gently .
n01-009-s01-00.png	 I 'll
n01-009-s01-01.png	be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
n01-009-s01-02.png	evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
n01-009-s01-03.png	both at midnight . 
n01-009-s02-00.png	They might have been
n01-009-s02-01.png	arranging a supper party .
n01-009-s03-00.png	Then she rang off .
n01-009-s04-00.png	Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
n01-009-s04-01.png	uneventful life had he come across a girl who
n01-009-s04-02.png	sounded so charming and appeared to be so
n01-009-s04-03.png	efficient .
n01-020-s00-00.png	For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
n01-020-s00-01.png	to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
n01-020-s00-02.png	physical features were distinguishable solely by
n01-020-s00-03.png	gradations of silvery greyness .
n01-020-s01-00.png	Even the snow-
n01-020-s01-01.png	capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles
n01-020-s01-02.png	below , was not recognisable among the host
n01-020-s01-03.png	of lower peaks .
n01-020-s02-00.png	The screen of the air-to-air
n01-020-s02-01.png	radar glowed .
n01-020-s03-00.png	Occasionally minute spots
n01-020-s03-01.png	flickered across its surface , but there was
n01-020-s03-02.png	no permanent image .
n01-031-s00-00.png	In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
n01-031-s00-01.png	make a direct comparison between the radar
n01-031-s00-02.png	image and the ground itself .
n01-031-s01-00.png	Ahead lay the
n01-031-s01-01.png	Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the
n01-031-s01-02.png	left , Milan .
n01-031-s02-00.png	The directional angle of the
n01-031-s02-01.png	scanner could be adjusted to cover any
n01-031-s02-02.png	particular area within its range .
n01-031-s03-00.png	Geoffrey
n01-031-s03-01.png	turned the scale slowly to cover the
n01-031-s03-02.png	ground immediately ahead .
n01-036-s00-00.png	He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the
n01-036-s00-01.png	naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even
n01-036-s00-02.png	on the clearest night limited angular vision .
n01-036-s01-00.png	He glanced
n01-036-s01-01.png	at the speed recorder .
n01-036-s02-00.png	It seemed almost incredible that
n01-036-s02-01.png	the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
n01-036-s02-02.png	was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
n01-045-s00-00.png	Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the
n01-045-s00-01.png	pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
n01-045-s00-02.png	dipped slightly .
n01-045-s01-00.png	The needle of the speed
n01-045-s01-01.png	recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0
n01-045-s01-02.png	before coming to rest at 5.0 .
n01-045-s02-00.png	 We 're a bit
n01-045-s02-01.png	ahead of time , said Alastair .
n01-045-s03-00.png	 We 'll run
n01-045-s03-01.png	in on minimum engine power . 
n01-045-s04-00.png	Geoffrey
n01-045-s04-01.png	smiled .
n01-045-s05-00.png	Alastair talked of running in when
n01-045-s05-01.png	they were still more than four hundred
n01-045-s05-02.png	miles from their destination .
n01-052-s00-00.png	They were nearing Modena .
n01-052-s01-00.png	Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
n01-052-s01-01.png	on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port .
n01-052-s02-00.png	He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
n01-052-s02-01.png	thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,
n01-052-s02-02.png	along which he had motored so desperately little
n01-052-s02-03.png	more than twenty-four hours earlier .
n01-052-s03-00.png	Since then
n01-052-s03-01.png	he had flown to England , attended the vital
n01-052-s03-02.png	conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked
n01-052-s03-03.png	by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
n01-052-s03-04.png	Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed
n01-052-s03-05.png	refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
n01-052-s03-06.png	of the journey back to the place where every
n01-052-s03-07.png	indication pointed to Eve being held .
n01-057-s00-00.png	Geoffrey set himself to consider the
n01-057-s00-01.png	movements of the Bentley .
n01-057-s01-00.png	It had passed
n01-057-s01-01.png	him at the temporary bridge over the
n01-057-s01-02.png	Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
n01-057-s01-03.png	previous night .
n01-057-s02-00.png	He worked out the distance
n01-057-s02-01.png	on the presumption that its route had been
n01-057-s02-02.png	through Florence and Rome and then
n01-057-s02-03.png	across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
n01-057-s03-00.png	It came to just over six hundred
n01-057-s03-01.png	miles .
n02-000-s00-00.png	DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
n02-000-s00-01.png	time they docked at Belleray .
n02-000-s01-00.png	And though Guy ,
n02-000-s01-01.png	made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless
n02-000-s01-02.png	speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that
n02-000-s01-03.png	the party was over .
n02-000-s02-00.png	Piers came strolling out to
n02-000-s02-01.png	meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had
n02-000-s02-02.png	driven away , invited them casually to come to
n02-000-s02-03.png	his flat for a drink .
n02-004-s00-00.png	To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
n02-004-s00-01.png	vengeance .
n02-004-s01-00.png	She had expected to be met with violent
n02-004-s01-01.png	reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
n02-004-s02-00.png	But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
n02-004-s02-01.png	was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
n02-004-s03-00.png	He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
n02-004-s03-01.png	own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
n02-004-s03-02.png	asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
n02-004-s03-03.png	to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
n02-009-s00-00.png	 I caught him just as he was going to the
n02-009-s00-01.png	airport to meet Blanche , he said .
n02-009-s01-00.png	 As a matter
n02-009-s01-01.png	of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
n02-009-s01-02.png	for me and fetch her .
n02-009-s02-00.png	He brought her to the party
n02-009-s02-01.png	too .
n02-009-s03-00.png	They 're both here . 
n02-009-s04-00.png	 I didn't know she was
n02-009-s04-01.png	coming back from Barbados so soon . 
n02-009-s05-00.png	Beryl
n02-009-s05-01.png	said the first thing that came into her head .
n02-016-s00-00.png	 Oh , she was due ! 
n02-016-s01-00.png	And then he added in the same
n02-016-s01-01.png	casual tone ,
n02-016-s02-00.png	 She 's not returning to her family .
n02-016-s03-00.png	She 's
n02-016-s03-01.png	going to live with friends of the bank manager , just
n02-016-s03-02.png	this side of Belleray . 
n02-016-s04-00.png	Mrs. Deane made a suitable
n02-016-s04-01.png	comment , but Beryl said nothing .
n02-016-s05-00.png	She was trying
n02-016-s05-01.png	to sort things out in her mind .
n02-016-s06-00.png	That beneath his
n02-016-s06-01.png	unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
n02-016-s06-02.png	with anger against her she had no doubt .
n02-028-s00-00.png	Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to
n02-028-s00-01.png	express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
n02-028-s00-02.png	of his guests .
n02-028-s01-00.png	But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl
n02-028-s01-01.png	suggested having a second party , the following week , he
n02-028-s01-02.png	poured cold water on the project .
n02-028-s02-00.png	Everyone , he declared ,
n02-028-s02-01.png	had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them
n02-028-s02-02.png	nearly to next week to settle down again .
n02-028-s03-00.png	Meanwhile
n02-028-s03-01.png	Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
n02-028-s03-02.png	earned gratuity to his native village at the
n02-028-s03-03.png	north of the island .
n02-033-s00-00.png	It was all over and done with .
n02-033-s01-00.png	For the time being Beryl was content to let
n02-033-s01-01.png	it go at that , but she resolved to have
n02-033-s01-02.png	it out with Piers when a reasonable
n02-033-s01-03.png	opportunity presented itself .
n02-033-s02-00.png	He must
n02-033-s02-01.png	learn that he could not treat her
n02-033-s02-02.png	with injustice and contempt , ignoring
n02-033-s02-03.png	her explanations as though he were
n02-033-s02-04.png	a schoolmaster and she a small ,
n02-033-s02-05.png	ignorant child .
n02-037-s00-00.png	He gave her no chance of any private
n02-037-s00-01.png	conversation that evening , for when
n02-037-s00-02.png	Blanche and Jack left , he went with
n02-037-s00-03.png	them .
n02-037-s01-00.png	But next morning she insisted
n02-037-s01-01.png	on his taking her out in the jeep -
n02-037-s01-02.png	to find , if possible , Hubert and his
n02-037-s01-03.png	relations , and tell them of
n02-037-s01-04.png	her great disappointment at being
n02-037-s01-05.png	held up in Balicou .
n02-040-s00-00.png	With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his
n02-040-s00-01.png	Boxer , to the back , and made room for her
n02-040-s00-02.png	beside him .
n02-040-s01-00.png	 Is that all you want to do ? 
n02-040-s01-01.png	he asked , letting in the clutch .
n02-040-s02-00.png	 No ; I want
n02-040-s02-01.png	to make you understand just what happened
n02-040-s02-02.png	about this Balicou trip , she returned
n02-040-s02-03.png	coldly .
n02-040-s03-00.png	 I 'm a little tired of being treated
n02-040-s03-01.png	like an ineffective imbecile . 
n02-045-s00-00.png	 And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called
n02-045-s00-01.png	to account for my manners , he retorted .
n02-045-s01-00.png	 What have I done wrong now ?
n02-045-s02-00.png	I cover up for
n02-045-s02-01.png	you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
n02-045-s02-02.png	to make the presentation , I run the damned
n02-045-s02-03.png	party to the best of my ability - saying the
n02-045-s02-04.png	sugary things you ought to have been there
n02-045-s02-05.png	to say - and all you can do is to find
n02-045-s02-06.png	fault . 
n02-049-s00-00.png	 It 's your superior attitude that riles me . 
n02-049-s01-00.png	Beryl was
n02-049-s01-01.png	scarlet with annoyance .
n02-049-s02-00.png	 How I happened to be marooned
n02-049-s02-01.png	at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree .
n02-049-s03-00.png	You
n02-049-s03-01.png	look as though it was only what you expected of me ,
n02-049-s03-02.png	as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
n02-049-s03-03.png	and his pals down . 
n02-054-s00-00.png	 As your employee it 's not my business
n02-054-s00-01.png	to understand all the whys and
n02-054-s00-02.png	wherefores of your actions , he said
n02-054-s00-03.png	stiffly .
n02-054-s01-00.png	 Still less to criticise you . 
n02-054-s02-00.png	 Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !
n02-054-s03-00.png	Be yourself , she exclaimed , with
n02-054-s03-01.png	mounting exasperation .
n02-054-s04-00.png	 Very well ! 
n02-054-s05-00.png	He
n02-054-s05-01.png	brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
n02-054-s05-02.png	path fringed and shaded by citrus trees .
n02-054-s06-00.png	 If you want my true opinion I 'll give it .
n02-062-s00-00.png	You made some sort of a protest to Graybury .
n02-062-s01-00.png	I 'll give you credit for that .
n02-062-s02-00.png	But you didn't press
n02-062-s02-01.png	the matter because , very naturally , you were
n02-062-s02-02.png	thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
n02-062-s02-03.png	idyllic surroundings . 
n02-062-s03-00.png	 How dare you say
n02-062-s03-01.png	such a thing ? she blazed .
n02-062-s04-00.png	 For goodness'
n02-062-s04-01.png	sake show a glimmer of reason , was his
n02-062-s04-02.png	equally indignant rejoinder .
n02-082a-s00-00.png	 You talk as though we were alone on Balicou ! 
n02-082a-s01-00.png	She avoided his gaze , and tried to ignore that
n02-082a-s01-01.png	last impertinent remark .
n02-082a-s02-00.png	 With four other people - 
n02-082a-s03-00.png	 Whom you never once managed to circumvent . 
n02-082a-s04-00.png	The mockery in his voice had deepened .
n02-082a-s05-00.png	 With
n02-082a-s05-01.png	all due deference , Miss Deane - come off it ! 
n02-082a-s06-00.png	She met his eyes then .
n02-098-s00-00.png	She wavered , and at last said
n02-098-s00-01.png	slowly ,
n02-098-s01-00.png	 If you must drag the truth
n02-098-s01-01.png	out of me , I must ask you to regard
n02-098-s01-02.png	it as confidential . 
n02-098-s02-00.png	 My dear Beryl ,
n02-098-s02-01.png	don't tell me anything , if you 'd rather
n02-098-s02-02.png	not . 
n02-098-s03-00.png	He was clearly startled by her
n02-098-s03-01.png	words .
n02-098-s04-00.png	 But remember , it was you ,
n02-098-s04-01.png	not I , who started this conversation . 
n02-104-s00-00.png	 I know .
n02-104-s01-00.png	Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want
n02-104-s01-01.png	you to think badly of me . 
n02-104-s02-00.png	She turned away
n02-104-s02-01.png	from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something
n02-104-s02-02.png	amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to
n02-104-s02-03.png	gain her attention .
n02-104-s03-00.png	 The truth is that
n02-104-s03-01.png	if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
n02-104-s03-02.png	time originally arranged , Sir John would
n02-104-s03-03.png	have had it in for Guy .
n02-109-s00-00.png	You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake
n02-109-s00-01.png	on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
n02-109-s00-02.png	flamingoes our first morning on the island . 
n02-109-s01-00.png	 What harm could possibly have come to Forrest
n02-109-s01-01.png	through Sir John's nonsense ? 
n02-109-s02-00.png	Piers could
n02-109-s02-01.png	hardly have spoken with more contempt .
n02-109-s03-00.png	A bully like that respects anyone who
n02-109-s03-01.png	dares to stand up to him . 
n02-114-s00-00.png	Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
n02-114-s00-01.png	precisely the remark she had made to Guy .
n02-114-s01-00.png	She said icily ,
n02-114-s02-00.png	 As you pride yourself on
n02-114-s02-01.png	your knowledge of all the affairs of the
n02-114-s02-02.png	island I needn't tell you that Sir John
n02-114-s02-03.png	Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
n02-114-s02-04.png	important customers . 
n02-114-s03-00.png	 So what ?
n02-114-s04-00.png	You 're not
n02-114-s04-01.png	trying to say that Hewson would victimise
n02-114-s04-02.png	Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
n02-114-s04-03.png	courage !
n02-120-s00-00.png	He 's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
n02-120-s00-01.png	himself and his business to an unmention-
n02-120-s00-02.png	able destination . 
n02-120-s01-00.png	 There 's a difference
n02-120-s01-01.png	between what a senior and a junior
n02-120-s01-02.png	partner can do , was her quick reply .
n02-120-s02-00.png	 What they can bring off !
n02-120-s03-00.png	I 'll admit that .
n02-120-s04-00.png	But Forrest might at least have tried .
n02-120-s05-00.png	He 's
n02-120-s05-01.png	pretty spineless ! 
n02-127-s00-00.png	 You think you could have carried more weight
n02-127-s00-01.png	with Sir John ? she enquired cuttingly .
n02-127-s01-00.png	 For all your good opinion of yourself ,
n02-127-s01-01.png	I doubt it .
n02-127-s02-00.png	He 's about as easy to push around
n02-127-s02-01.png	as - as a grounded whale ! 
n02-127-s03-00.png	He had to smile
n02-127-s03-01.png	at that , but went on airily ,
n02-127-s04-00.png	 I 'd have made
n02-127-s04-01.png	an attempt to show my lady-love that I
n02-127-s04-02.png	put her interests before my own .
n02-146-s00-00.png	She was tempted to laugh , but it was as though that barb still stuck
n02-146-s00-01.png	in her quivering flesh .
n02-146-s01-00.png	 You 've an answer - of sorts - for everything , she
n02-146-s01-01.png	said shortly .
n02-146-s02-00.png	 Personally I 've no more to say , so I suggest we get
n02-146-s02-01.png	along . 
n02-146-s03-00.png	To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses
n02-146-s03-01.png	where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in
n02-146-s03-02.png	leisurely fashion his few possessions into a ramshackle and
n02-146-s03-03.png	incredibly ancient car , surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives .
n02-151-s00-00.png	Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
n02-151-s00-01.png	to have been guests at yesterday's
n02-151-s00-02.png	celebrations , and their friendly welcome
n02-151-s00-03.png	and warm sympathy , as she explained
n02-151-s00-04.png	how she had come to miss the party ,
n02-151-s00-05.png	made her send a complacent glance
n02-151-s00-06.png	in Piers' direction .
n02-151-s01-00.png	What a fuss-box the
n02-151-s01-01.png	man was , she thought impatiently ,
n02-151-s01-02.png	trying to worry her into the belief
n02-151-s01-03.png	that her failure to appear at a function
n02-151-s01-04.png	on the estate was a major error :
n02-154-s00-00.png	And then she received a jolt .
n02-154-s01-00.png	Old Hubert , standing
n02-154-s01-01.png	beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his
n02-154-s01-02.png	toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her
n02-154-s01-03.png	in halting 6patois that 3Mistah Piers had
n02-154-s01-04.png	explained right at the start that 3Mis' Beryl 
n02-154-s01-05.png	would be 3 plenty , plenty sad not to be back
n02-154-s01-06.png	at the Villa in time .
n02-157-s00-00.png	That it wouldn't be her fault at all .
n02-157-s01-00.png	That
n02-157-s01-01.png	she was a lady who , like her Uncle Charles ,
n02-157-s01-02.png	took the highest pride in keeping her word .
n02-157-s02-00.png	 I
n02-157-s02-01.png	could see 3anudder 3t'ing , he went on in a
n02-157-s02-02.png	lower voice , his sunken black eyes twinkling .
n02-157-s03-00.png	3 He powerful anxious , poor Mistah Piers .
n02-157-s04-00.png	We all know how Balicou Island dangerous
n02-157-s04-01.png	to all kin' o' boats , wid d'ose big , big
n02-157-s04-02.png	rocks in an' out o' de water .
n03-038-s00-00.png	He had almost entirely settled back into his old
n03-038-s00-01.png	ways , even to reading law about two hours each
n03-038-s00-02.png	day .
n03-038-s01-00.png	Though he did not refuse wine , which the
n03-038-s01-01.png	judge always had on the table at dinner , he
n03-038-s01-02.png	did not act as though he found it necessary
n03-038-s01-03.png	except in moderate compliance with his father's
n03-038-s01-04.png	habit .
n03-064-s00-00.png	Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
n03-064-s00-01.png	white spray could be seen flying across the distance
n03-064-s00-02.png	of a mile and a half , came the yawl under her full
n03-064-s00-03.png	triangular sail , and to the judge's frightened eyes , so
n03-064-s00-04.png	close to the rocks that it would be dashed
n03-064-s00-05.png	against them with the lift of the next wave .
n03-066-s00-00.png	 That boy !
n03-066-s01-00.png	That damned fool boy !
n03-066-s02-00.png	What does he mean
n03-066-s02-01.png	by trying to come home now , even if he did promise ?
n03-066-s03-00.png	What does time mean when weighed against the life of
n03-066-s03-01.png	two human beings ? 
n03-066-s04-00.png	Not until he was certain that the
n03-066-s04-01.png	yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
n03-066-s04-02.png	being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
n03-066-s04-03.png	empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
n03-066-s04-04.png	with part of that howling northwest gale .
n03-079-s00-00.png	When the wind was on a rampage , as it was
n03-079-s00-01.png	now , it could kick up a sea-sized commotion
n03-079-s00-02.png	where it had a straight blow of eight miles
n03-079-s00-03.png	down the lake .
n03-079-s01-00.png	3 Big blow , Judge , re-
n03-079-s01-01.png	marked Willie Kim as the wind billowed
n03-079-s01-02.png	out and sucked in his baggy black
n03-079-s01-03.png	blouse and pantaloons .
n03-082-s00-00.png	3 Blow like hell .
n03-082-s01-00.png	Maybe by and by
n03-082-s01-01.png	she blow some more . 
n03-082-s02-00.png	 Hello , Willie , where
n03-082-s02-01.png	did you come from ? the judge said in
n03-082-s02-02.png	mild surprise .
n03-082-s03-00.png	 I didn't hear you .
n03-082-s04-00.png	Do you
n03-082-s04-01.png	see that fool boy of mine out there on
n03-082-s04-02.png	the lake ? 
n03-082-s05-00.png	3 I see him .
n03-082-s06-00.png	You don't need
n03-082-s06-01.png	worry , Judge .
n03-082-s07-00.png	Big wind like that can't
n03-082-s07-01.png	drown good man .
n03-091-s00-00.png	Bill is good man , and Bueno Buck is raised on lake .
n03-091-s01-00.png	He no drown , too .
n03-091-s02-00.png	Him , his mother throw him into
n03-091-s02-01.png	water to make him swim when he is born .
n03-091-s03-00.png	Maybe so Bill , he can swim that good , too . 
n03-091-s04-00.png	The yawl , riding the high waves with an air that
n03-091-s04-01.png	might have made an ocean liner envious , seemed
n03-091-s04-02.png	prepared to make a safe though violent landing
n03-091-s04-03.png	when there came a sudden gust of wind
n03-091-s04-04.png	from the west .
n03-097-s00-00.png	 My God ! the judge cried out .
n03-097-s01-00.png	 The boy
n03-097-s01-01.png	is going to try to make a landing on the
n03-097-s01-02.png	weather side of that pier !
n03-097-s02-00.png	He 'll wreck ! 
n03-097-s03-00.png	Willie Kim was speechless , only his slant
n03-097-s03-01.png	black eyes showing any emotion .
n03-097-s04-00.png	With a
n03-097-s04-01.png	quick shift of tiller , and at the same time
n03-097-s04-02.png	jibbing the boom to which he had the
n03-097-s04-03.png	stay rope fastened , Bill made the
n03-097-s04-04.png	yawl recover .
n03-103-s00-00.png	It seemed to the frightened judge
n03-103-s00-01.png	as though his son would actually
n03-103-s00-02.png	shoot the craft in under the outer
n03-103-s00-03.png	end of the wharf .
n03-103-s01-00.png	But by pressing
n03-103-s01-01.png	the tiller hard over and at the
n03-103-s01-02.png	same time dropping the small sheet
n03-103-s01-03.png	of wet canvas , Bill cleared the
n03-103-s01-04.png	corner of the pier by inches , and
n03-103-s01-05.png	with the tiller still hard over , brought
n03-103-s01-06.png	the yawl up against the waves
n03-106-s00-00.png	 Willie , the judge said huskily ,
n03-106-s00-01.png	 that was as pretty a piece of seamans-
n03-106-s00-02.png	hip as I ever saw .
n03-106-s01-00.png	That boy of
n03-106-s01-01.png	mine seems to know how to do
n03-106-s01-02.png	everything , when he wants to . 
n03-106-s02-00.png	 3Naw , disputed Willie .
n03-106-s03-00.png	3 Just
n03-106-s03-01.png	play in damn fine luck this time .
n03-106-s04-00.png	He plenty smart though . 
n03-106-s05-00.png	As they
n03-106-s05-01.png	reached the pier , the judge on legs
n03-106-s05-02.png	that were a little unsteady , they
n03-106-s05-03.png	found Bueno Buck , now on the
n03-106-s05-04.png	pier , leading the yawl toward
n03-113-s00-00.png	 Hello , Dad ! Bill called .
n03-113-s01-00.png	 I hope you
n03-113-s01-01.png	weren't worried .
n03-113-s02-00.png	We 're going to
n03-113-s02-01.png	drag the boat ashore and turn
n03-113-s02-02.png	her over .
n03-113-s03-00.png	She has a foot of
n03-113-s03-01.png	water in her .
n03-113-s04-00.png	I wouldn't be
n03-113-s04-01.png	surprised if we broke all
n03-113-s04-02.png	speed records on the way in .
n03-113-s05-00.png	Yes sir , I am slightly wet , and
n03-113-s05-01.png	Buck would be wetter if he
n03-113-s05-02.png	had more clothes on . 
n03-120-s00-00.png	With four doing the job and the waves
n03-120-s00-01.png	pushing at the stern , the yawl was soon
n03-120-s00-02.png	dragged out but before it was turned
n03-120-s00-03.png	over Bueno Buck reached into the foot
n03-120-s00-04.png	of water , tossed out a string of silvery
n03-120-s00-05.png	lake trout and said -
n03-120-s01-00.png	3 Bill , he 's better
n03-120-s01-01.png	man at catch 'em than Injun , Judge .
n03-120-s02-00.png	You look .
n03-120-s03-00.png	Little one more as fifteen
n03-120-s03-01.png	inches .
n03-120-s04-00.png	Maybe big one four feet ,
n03-120-s04-01.png	huh ? 
n03-126-s00-00.png	 By George , that is a beautiful string of fish ! 
n03-126-s00-01.png	exclaimed the judge .
n03-126-s01-00.png	 Toss them on the grass
n03-126-s01-01.png	and then we 'll all get hold and heave . 
n03-126-s02-00.png	A
n03-126-s02-01.png	few moments later the yawl was upside
n03-126-s02-02.png	down , exposing its shallow keel .
n04-000-s00-00.png	Bertram's face was grim .
n04-000-s01-00.png	 You think it was the Snort ,
n04-000-s01-01.png	don't you ? 
n04-000-s02-00.png	John gave a short laugh .
n04-000-s03-00.png	 I did , he
n04-000-s03-01.png	said ; but I 'd better stop thinking that now .
n04-000-s04-00.png	Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one . 
n04-000-s05-00.png	 So there you are , my dear . 
n04-000-s06-00.png	Peggy 's eyes filled
n04-000-s06-01.png	with tears .
n04-000-s07-00.png	 It 's so unfair , she said .
n04-009-s00-00.png	 That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six
n04-009-s00-01.png	months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
n04-009-s00-02.png	dockyard and now that she 's ready for sea he goes
n04-009-s00-03.png	sick .
n04-009-s01-00.png	Just because he 's an Honourable he can do
n04-009-s01-01.png	what he likes .
n04-009-s02-00.png	Anyway , why pick on you to succeed
n04-009-s02-01.png	him ? 
n04-009-s03-00.png	John didn't answer .
n04-009-s04-00.png	There was no point
n04-009-s04-01.png	in sharing his discomfort with Peggy .
n04-015-s00-00.png	A submariner's wife needed to be spared as much
n04-015-s00-01.png	as possible .
n04-015-s01-00.png	Anyway the Parsifal affair was far
n04-015-s01-01.png	too fresh in both their minds to be a comfortable
n04-015-s01-02.png	subject for discussion .
n04-015-s02-00.png	 It 's a command , he said .
n04-015-s03-00.png	We can do with the extra money .
n04-015-s04-00.png	It 'll just about
n04-015-s04-01.png	pay Jacky's school fees . 
n04-015-s05-00.png	 What shall we do
n04-015-s05-01.png	about this house ? - and Jill's school ? - and oh !
n04-015-s05-02.png	how I hate the Navy !
n04-022-s00-00.png	If I 'd known what it would be like I 'd sooner
n04-022-s00-01.png	have married a parson . 
n04-022-s01-00.png	He kissed her .
n04-022-s02-00.png	 Parsons
n04-022-s02-01.png	work on Sundays , he said .
n04-022-s03-00.png	 They 're worse off than
n04-022-s03-01.png	submariners .
n04-022-s04-00.png	You ought to have married that fat
n04-022-s04-01.png	stockbroker chap and shared him with his three
n04-022-s04-02.png	mistresses .
n04-022-s05-00.png	Anyway it might be much worse .
n04-022-s06-00.png	Pericles is a Portsmouth boat .
n04-022-s07-00.png	She spends longer
n04-022-s07-01.png	in harbour than any other submarine .
n04-031-s00-00.png	Practically a shore job .
n04-031-s01-00.png	Cheer up . 
n04-031-s02-00.png	She wiped
n04-031-s02-01.png	her eyes and reached for her address book .
n04-031-s03-00.png	 I 'll
n04-031-s03-01.png	write to those agents and try to get a flat in
n04-031-s03-02.png	Alverstoke , she said .
n04-031-s04-00.png	 But I don't know what
n04-031-s04-01.png	Jill will say about leaving her school .
n04-031-s05-00.png	It 's a
n04-031-s05-01.png	blessing that Jacky 's off to boarding school .
n04-031-s06-00.png	And all the trouble you 've taken with the
n04-031-s06-01.png	garden !
n04-039-s00-00.png	That little beast , Robbie Munyard ! 
n04-039-s01-00.png	Having
n04-039-s01-01.png	said her say Peggy manfully shouldered her
n04-039-s01-02.png	burden and prepared to break up yet
n04-039-s01-03.png	another home .
n04-039-s02-00.png	In the ten years of married life
n04-039-s02-01.png	this had already happened half a dozen times .
n04-039-s03-00.png	Such is the life of a naval officer's wife .
n04-044-s00-00.png	John's father had been a naval officer of the old
n04-044-s00-01.png	school ; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
n04-044-s00-02.png	on to the second generation .
n04-044-s01-00.png	One of these was that
n04-044-s01-01.png	an officer should join a ship , on taking up a
n04-044-s01-02.png	new appointment , at nine a.m. precisely , dressed
n04-044-s01-03.png	in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword .
n04-044-s02-00.png	It would have been acceptable to all concerned
n04-044-s02-01.png	if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
n04-044-s02-02.png	plain-clothes on the previous night , but ways
n04-044-s02-03.png	instilled by martinet parents have a habit of
n04-044-s02-04.png	sticking .
n04-048-s00-00.png	So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head , that
n04-048-s00-01.png	famous Portsmouth hostelry , second only in historic
n04-048-s00-02.png	interest to The George , unhappily destroyed by German
n04-048-s00-03.png	bombs during the last war .
n04-048-s01-00.png	Having deposited his
n04-048-s01-01.png	baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
n04-048-s01-02.png	went in search of a drink .
n04-048-s02-00.png	The lower bar was
n04-048-s02-01.png	empty , save for the lady known by all habitue
n04-048-s02-02.png	*?2s as ' Seaweed ' , and a youngish , sharp-eyed
n04-048-s02-03.png	man who was staring moodily into a gin
n04-048-s02-04.png	and tonic .
n04-052-s00-00.png	Seaweed's memory was prodigious ; her manner
n04-052-s00-01.png	must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
n04-052-s00-02.png	of the hotel .
n04-052-s01-00.png	She greeted John , however , with less
n04-052-s01-01.png	than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
n04-052-s01-02.png	glance at him .
n04-052-s02-00.png	Evidently the other occupant
n04-052-s02-01.png	of the bar was not 6persona grata .
n04-052-s03-00.png	If her
n04-052-s03-01.png	memory was good , so was this stranger's .
n04-052-s04-00.png	 You 're Commander Winter , he said .
n04-052-s05-00.png	 Have a
n04-052-s05-01.png	gin ? 
n04-052-s06-00.png	He turned to Seaweed -
n04-060-s00-00.png	 Make it a large one , darling .
n04-060-s01-00.png	I know the naval
n04-060-s01-01.png	habits .
n04-060-s02-00.png	' Drink gin and call each other wallahs ,
n04-060-s02-01.png	what ! ' - as the Guards officer said on his return
n04-060-s02-02.png	from a visit to the Royal Navy .
n04-060-s03-00.png	Submarines , what .
n04-060-s04-00.png	Youngest D.S.C. in the war , what ?
n04-060-s05-00.png	Crawled
n04-060-s05-01.png	inside a submarine casing to defuse a Jerry
n04-060-s05-02.png	bomb .
n04-060-s06-00.png	Should have been a V.C.
n04-068-s00-00.png	What are you waiting for , darling ?
n04-068-s01-00.png	The officer is
n04-068-s01-01.png	obviously thirsty . 
n04-068-s02-00.png	John fought back his
n04-068-s02-01.png	inherited desire to snub the man .
n04-068-s03-00.png	If he did he
n04-068-s03-01.png	would have to leave the bar and either sit in
n04-068-s03-02.png	the lounge or return to his bedroom .
n04-068-s04-00.png	Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
n04-068-s04-01.png	came to the rescue .
n04-068-s05-00.png	 You haven't introduced
n04-068-s05-01.png	yourself , she said with mock severity .
n04-075-s00-00.png	 It 's a rule on these premises .
n04-075-s01-00.png	No treating with
n04-075-s01-01.png	strangers - that 's right , John , isn't it ? 
n04-075-s02-00.png	 My
n04-075-s02-01.png	fault entirely , said the stranger .
n04-075-s03-00.png	 It 's my conceited
n04-075-s03-01.png	nature - I assumed that you both knew who I
n04-075-s03-02.png	was .
n04-075-s04-00.png	I 'm Ian Bawley .
n04-075-s05-00.png	Does that mean anything
n04-075-s05-01.png	to you ? 
n04-075-s06-00.png	It did .
n04-075-s07-00.png	Ian Bawley's name was
n04-075-s07-01.png	printed at the head of most naval articles
n04-075-s07-02.png	in the Daily Courier .
n04-084-s00-00.png	 Oh , the Press , said Seaweed .
n04-084-s01-00.png	 Down here on business , Mr.
n04-084-s01-01.png	Bawley ? 
n04-084-s02-00.png	 A pressman is always on the job . 
n04-084-s03-00.png	He held out his hand and John could not do
n04-084-s03-01.png	otherwise than take it .
n04-084-s04-00.png	 Pleased to meet you ,
n04-084-s04-01.png	Commander , he said .
n04-084-s05-00.png	 Now what about that
n04-084-s05-01.png	drink ? 
n04-084-s06-00.png	John nodded - he could afford to buy
n04-084-s06-01.png	one in return and he was lonely .
n04-092-s00-00.png	 For the sake of accuracy , he said , and I
n04-092-s00-01.png	know how you newspaper people value that commodity ! -
n04-092-s00-02.png	please don't address me as Commander .
n04-092-s01-00.png	I 'm
n04-092-s01-01.png	a Lieutenant-Commander .
n04-092-s02-00.png	Perhaps we could
n04-092-s02-01.png	drop the rank - such a mouthful ! 
n04-092-s03-00.png	 You 're
n04-092-s03-01.png	absolutely right , said Bawley , as he pushed over
n04-092-s03-02.png	his glass .
n04-092-s04-00.png	 Fill it up , darling .
n04-092-s05-00.png	Accuracy above
n04-092-s05-01.png	all else .
n04-092-s06-00.png	We pride ourselves about accuracy on
n04-092-s06-01.png	the Courier .
n04-100-s00-00.png	Ever known us bowl a wide about your Service ?
n04-100-s01-00.png	Check and counter-check - nothing but the truth .
n04-100-s02-00.png	Somewhat embarrassing , what ? 
n04-100-s03-00.png	 How can the
n04-100-s03-01.png	truth be embarrassing ? 
n04-100-s04-00.png	John sipped his double
n04-100-s04-01.png	gin with relish .
n04-100-s05-00.png	It was his favourite brand ,
n04-100-s05-01.png	he was on the verge of a new chapter in
n04-100-s05-02.png	his career , and his companion's attitude was
n04-100-s05-03.png	challenging .
n04-107-s00-00.png	Life at home and in Bath had been a
n04-107-s00-01.png	trifle too comfortable and humdrum .
n04-107-s01-00.png	He 'd never before met a pressman and
n04-107-s01-01.png	found him curiously stimulating .
n04-107-s02-00.png	 You 're a
n04-107-s02-01.png	bit of a humorist , aren't you ? said
n04-107-s02-02.png	Bawley .
n04-107-s03-00.png	 The truth is usually very embarra-
n04-107-s03-01.png	ssing .
n04-107-s04-00.png	You 're in submarines , aren't you ? 
n04-107-s05-00.png	 You know a great deal about me , 
n04-107-s05-01.png	said John .
n04-114-s00-00.png	 It 's my business .
n04-114-s01-00.png	I 'll tell you more .
n04-114-s02-00.png	You 're
n04-114-s02-01.png	going to take over command of Pericles .
n04-114-s03-00.png	Am I
n04-114-s03-01.png	right ? 
n04-114-s04-00.png	 Who told you ? 
n04-114-s05-00.png	 Little bird .
n04-114-s06-00.png	Other half ? 
n04-114-s07-00.png	John nodded .
n04-114-s08-00.png	 On me . 
n04-114-s09-00.png	Bawley
n04-114-s09-01.png	shook his head .
n04-114-s10-00.png	 All paid for by His Lordship , 
n04-114-s10-01.png	he said .
n04-114-s11-00.png	 Expense account .
n04-114-s12-00.png	You 're a married
n04-114-s12-01.png	man with a couple of kids .
n04-114-s13-00.png	Can't go wasting
n04-114-s13-01.png	your substance on a complete stranger .
n04-114-s14-00.png	Set
n04-114-s14-01.png	'em up , darling ! 
n04-130-s00-00.png	John flushed .
n04-130-s01-00.png	 I 'm not in need of charity . 
n04-130-s02-00.png	 Come
n04-130-s02-01.png	off it , said Bawley .
n04-130-s03-00.png	 The proprietor of the Daily
n04-130-s03-01.png	Courier knows what 's going on .
n04-130-s04-00.png	If he doesn't mind ,
n04-130-s04-01.png	why should you ? 
n04-130-s05-00.png	 I see . 
n04-130-s06-00.png	John took the
n04-130-s06-01.png	refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
n04-130-s06-02.png	companion .
n04-130-s07-00.png	 You want me to talk , is that it ? 
n04-139-s00-00.png	 You misjudge me , said Bawley .
n04-139-s01-00.png	 You have
n04-139-s01-01.png	nothing to tell me , yet .
n04-139-s02-00.png	But we 'll be meeting
n04-139-s02-01.png	again , no doubt , and then you will have .
n04-139-s03-00.png	Regard this as a softening-up process , and
n04-139-s03-01.png	have dinner with me ?
n04-139-s04-00.png	On His Lordship ,
n04-139-s04-01.png	of course . 
n04-139-s05-00.png	 On one condition , said John .
n04-139-s06-00.png	 Tell me who the little bird was . 
n04-139-s07-00.png	 Can't
n04-139-s07-01.png	you guess ?
n04-139-s08-00.png	Whose portrait appears regularly
n04-139-s08-01.png	in the shiny papers ? 
n04-149-s00-00.png	 You mean Munyard ? 
n04-149-s01-00.png	 Sure .
n04-149-s02-00.png	Very useful
n04-149-s02-01.png	contact , is our Robbie ; he gives us the gen and
n04-149-s02-02.png	we give him the publicity .
n04-149-s03-00.png	' The Honourable
n04-149-s03-01.png	 Robbie and friend ' , what ?
n04-149-s04-00.png	You know the
n04-149-s04-01.png	sort of thing . 
n04-149-s05-00.png	 You 'll get nothing out of me , 
n04-149-s05-01.png	said John , but you can pay for my drinks
n04-149-s05-02.png	if you want to , as long as you keep off
n04-149-s05-03.png	Service matters . 
n04-156-s00-00.png	 Good-oh !
n04-156-s01-00.png	One for the grill-room , darling , and
n04-156-s01-01.png	tell George to bring in the 6carte du jour . 
n04-156-s02-00.png	Bawley was a man of his word .
n04-156-s03-00.png	He kept
n04-156-s03-01.png	away from Service matters , was an excellent
n04-156-s03-02.png	host and a splendid raconteur .
n04-156-s04-00.png	The evening
n04-156-s04-01.png	passed all too quickly .
n04-156-s05-00.png	As they parted in
n04-156-s05-01.png	the vestibule the two men were well
n04-156-s05-02.png	disposed towards each other .
n04-163-s00-00.png	 Ever been to Fleet Street ? asked Bawley .
n04-163-s01-00.png	 You should .
n04-163-s02-00.png	Next time you 're in Town
n04-163-s02-01.png	give me a ring at this number and I 'll
n04-163-s02-02.png	take you round the pubs where most
n04-163-s02-03.png	of the work is done . 
n04-163-s03-00.png	He held out a card .
n04-163-s04-00.png	John took it and put it in his pocket .
n04-163-s05-00.png	 Thanks , he said .
n04-163-s06-00.png	 If ever my missus
n04-163-s06-01.png	lets me off the chain I 'll take you
n04-163-s06-02.png	up on that .
n04-171-s00-00.png	Ever been out in a submarine ?
n04-171-s01-00.png	I 'll give
n04-171-s01-01.png	you a spin round one of these days , if you
n04-171-s01-02.png	like .
n04-171-s02-00.png	You could write it up . 
n04-171-s03-00.png	Bawley made a face .
n04-171-s04-00.png	 Not in Pericles , old man . 
n04-171-s05-00.png	 Why not ? 
n04-171-s06-00.png	 Better ask Robbie Munyard . 
n04-171-s07-00.png	 What 's he been
n04-171-s07-01.png	saying ? 
n04-171-s08-00.png	John was furious .
n04-171-s09-00.png	The little squirt !
n04-171-s10-00.png	To go gassing to a newspaper man !
n04-183-s00-00.png	 Look ! he went on earnestly .
n04-183-s01-00.png	 You 're not going
n04-183-s01-01.png	to write up Pericles in some way or other , are
n04-183-s01-02.png	you ? 
n04-183-s02-00.png	 What is there to write up ? said
n04-183-s02-01.png	Bawley .
n04-183-s03-00.png	 There are forty-three submarines in
n04-183-s03-01.png	the Navy - why should I pick on Pericles ? 
n04-183-s04-00.png	John eyed him steadily .
n04-183-s05-00.png	 It 's the Parcifal
n04-183-s05-01.png	business , isn't it ? he said quietly .
n04-190-s00-00.png	 I don't want it to happen again , said Bawley -
n04-190-s00-01.png	 more so than ever since I met you . 
n04-190-s01-00.png	 What did Munyard say ? 
n04-190-s02-00.png	 The Snort - hull
n04-190-s02-01.png	fitting fractured . 
n04-190-s03-00.png	 Supposing I was to tell you that
n04-190-s03-01.png	we 've had Pericles' entire Snort equipment removed
n04-190-s03-02.png	and X-rayed and that it was as sound as a bell ? 
n04-190-s03-03.png	said John .
n04-195-s00-00.png	 Munyard didn't tell me that .
n04-195-s01-00.png	But I must confess
n04-195-s01-01.png	I 'm relieved .
n04-195-s02-00.png	But it still doesn't do away
n04-195-s02-01.png	with the possibility of faulty design . 
n04-195-s03-00.png	He held
n04-195-s03-01.png	out his hand .
n04-195-s04-00.png	 Maybe I will take a trip with you
n04-195-s04-01.png	one of these days , he said .
n04-195-s05-00.png	 In the meantime
n04-195-s05-01.png	I 'll tell my editor that the story 's a dead bird .
n04-202-s00-00.png	Glad I met you .
n04-202-s01-00.png	Don't forget to give me a ring -
n04-202-s01-01.png	any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley , what ? 
n04-202-s02-00.png	 I don't know when that will be , said John .
n04-202-s03-00.png	 I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after
n04-202-s03-01.png	Master bloody Munyard . 
n04-202-s04-00.png	THERE were six submarines ,
n04-202-s04-01.png	lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
n04-202-s05-00.png	Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
n04-202-s05-01.png	sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they
n04-202-s05-02.png	charged their electric batteries .
n04-209-s00-00.png	A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
n04-209-s00-01.png	through the open windows of the Captain's house .
n04-209-s01-00.png	It
n04-209-s01-01.png	pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
n04-209-s01-02.png	Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
n04-209-s01-03.png	a substantial breakfast .
n04-209-s02-00.png	Although usually a very
n04-209-s02-01.png	talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
n04-209-s02-02.png	silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of
n04-209-s02-03.png	some sort .
n04-213-s00-00.png	There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
n04-213-s00-01.png	affair of Parsifal .
n04-213-s01-00.png	Harry had lost a good deal of weight .
n04-213-s02-00.png	His normal placid and steady-going manner remained ,
n04-213-s02-01.png	but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
n04-213-s03-00.png	It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
n04-213-s03-01.png	to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,
n04-213-s03-02.png	though in peace time these happenings are few and
n04-213-s03-03.png	far between .
n04-218-s00-00.png	This is the testing time for all .
n04-218-s01-00.png	The affair blows up into
n04-218-s01-01.png	a national disaster and then when it is all over life
n04-218-s01-02.png	must continue as before .
n04-218-s02-00.png	During this period the Captain
n04-218-s02-01.png	must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
n04-218-s02-02.png	if nothing unusual has happened .
n04-218-s03-00.png	Harry Turton had
n04-218-s03-01.png	written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the
n04-218-s03-02.png	locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven
n04-218-s03-03.png	his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
n04-218-s03-04.png	usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
n04-218-s03-05.png	suitable for such occasions .
n06-074-s00-00.png	He rode down to where I was waiting .
n06-074-s01-00.png	I was
n06-074-s01-01.png	thinking what a skill he had for reading
n06-074-s01-02.png	my mind .
n06-074-s02-00.png	 This would be as good a place
n06-074-s02-01.png	for a hold-up as any , he said , reining in
n06-074-s02-02.png	near me .
n06-074-s03-00.png	 Yes , I said .
n06-074-s04-00.png	 It 'll be here to-
n06-074-s04-01.png	morrow as likely as not . 
n06-074-s05-00.png	I paused .
n06-074-s06-00.png	 Miss
n06-074-s06-01.png	Jeannie 'll be on that coach , Dan . 
n06-082-s00-00.png	 Yes , he said .
n06-082-s01-00.png	 I know . 
n06-082-s02-00.png	 No harm must come
n06-082-s02-01.png	to her , Dan . 
n06-082-s03-00.png	 She 'll be all right .
n06-082-s04-00.png	It 's the
n06-082-s04-01.png	men who 'll be after that coach I 'm interested
n06-082-s04-02.png	in , Johnny . 
n06-082-s05-00.png	 I know .
n06-082-s06-00.png	But if lead starts
n06-082-s06-01.png	flying she might be in danger . 
n06-082-s07-00.png	 That 's so .
n06-082-s08-00.png	But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at
n06-082-s08-01.png	us to bother with the coach and the folks
n06-082-s08-02.png	in it . 
n06-092-s00-00.png	 Maybe , I said .
n06-092-s01-00.png	 But we 've got to remember
n06-092-s01-01.png	that girl all the time , Dan .
n06-092-s02-00.png	I feel kind
n06-092-s02-01.png	of responsible for her . 
n06-092-s03-00.png	 Of course , he said ,
n06-092-s03-01.png	giving me one of his strange looks .
n06-092-s04-00.png	Then he
n06-092-s04-01.png	turned the conversation .
n06-092-s05-00.png	 Let 's ride over
n06-092-s05-01.png	and have a look at the mining camp .
n06-092-s06-00.png	After all it 's them we 're supposed to be
n06-092-s06-01.png	working for , as well as the townsfolk and
n06-092-s06-02.png	the agency detective . 
n06-100-s00-00.png	With something of a start I remembered the
n06-100-s00-01.png	man who 'd brought us into this business .
n06-100-s01-00.png	 Maybe you don't know about Appleton ,
n06-100-s01-01.png	Dan ? 
n06-100-s02-00.png	 Know what ? 
n06-100-s03-00.png	 That he 's dead , 
n06-100-s03-01.png	I said .
n06-100-s04-00.png	I watched him because I was always
n06-100-s04-01.png	fascinated by the way he looked when you
n06-100-s04-02.png	tried to surprise him .
n06-100-s05-00.png	 Dead ? he said .
n06-100-s06-00.png	 Yes .
n06-100-s07-00.png	Dead .
n06-100-s08-00.png	Shuffled out of the deck .
n06-100-s09-00.png	Blasted
n06-100-s09-01.png	down with a shotgun outside the Palace
n06-100-s09-02.png	last night . 
n06-111-s00-00.png	 Fenton or Somers , he said .
n06-111-s01-00.png	 Or the Town
n06-111-s01-01.png	Marshal , I added .
n06-111-s02-00.png	His face was fixed ,
n06-111-s02-01.png	unreadable as a rock .
n06-111-s03-00.png	 Let 's get over to the
n06-111-s03-01.png	mining camp , he said abruptly .
n06-111-s04-00.png	He wheeled
n06-111-s04-01.png	his horse back off the trail and up the slope
n06-111-s04-02.png	leading to the ridge .
n06-111-s05-00.png	I followed .
n06-111-s06-00.png	From the
n06-111-s06-01.png	top you could see something of the wild hill
n06-111-s06-02.png	country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
n06-119-s00-00.png	The air was fresh and clear and you
n06-119-s00-01.png	could see far over west and north for many
n06-119-s00-02.png	miles .
n06-119-s01-00.png	The real high country of the Rockies
n06-119-s01-01.png	lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
n06-119-s01-02.png	colour drawing .
n06-119-s02-00.png	Between us and that lay
n06-119-s02-01.png	a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and
n06-119-s02-02.png	malpais .
n06-123-s00-00.png	 The mine-workings lie north of the town , 
n06-123-s00-01.png	said Dan .
n06-123-s01-00.png	 If we head west we ought to
n06-123-s01-01.png	cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north . 
n06-123-s02-00.png	So we swung west , making slow going over
n06-123-s02-01.png	rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down
n06-123-s02-02.png	into draws , circling a big mesa by a
n06-123-s02-03.png	four or five mile valley , sandy-floored .
n06-123-s03-00.png	It
n06-123-s03-01.png	got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
n06-123-s03-02.png	gratefully by a small creek where we watered
n06-123-s03-03.png	the horses and drank enough to cure our
n06-123-s03-04.png	thirst .
n06-128-s00-00.png	An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
n06-128-s00-01.png	we figured would lead to the miners' camp .
n06-128-s01-00.png	We turned north into it and after about four
n06-128-s01-01.png	miles it led into a small canyon which
n06-128-s01-02.png	opened out into a wide shallow draw .
n06-128-s02-00.png	Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
n06-128-s02-01.png	the miners at work .
n06-128-s03-00.png	They were scattered
n06-128-s03-01.png	over a fairly wide area working singly or
n06-128-s03-02.png	in pairs .
n06-133-s00-00.png	We didn't approach unchallenged .
n06-133-s01-00.png	Just short
n06-133-s01-01.png	of the diggings there was a roughly-built
n06-133-s01-02.png	shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
n06-133-s01-03.png	out ,
n06-133-s02-00.png	 If you come any closer , I 'll sure blow
n06-133-s02-01.png	your whiskers off . 
n06-133-s03-00.png	 Take it easy , mister , I sang
n06-133-s03-01.png	out .
n06-133-s04-00.png	 We don't aim to come any closer and we 've
n06-133-s04-01.png	got no whiskers so as you can see .
n06-133-s05-00.png	Just you
n06-133-s05-01.png	go and tell Nick Dowd we 've come to talk
n06-133-s05-02.png	to him about what happened last night . 
n06-140-s00-00.png	 Oh , said the unseen guard .
n06-140-s01-00.png	He blew a
n06-140-s01-01.png	whistle then , loud and shrill .
n06-140-s02-00.png	The gun barrel
n06-140-s02-01.png	peeking out through a hole in the shack never
n06-140-s02-02.png	wavered .
n06-140-s03-00.png	We sat our horses , waiting .
n06-140-s04-00.png	 Looks as
n06-140-s04-01.png	though they 're expecting trouble , I said .
n06-140-s05-00.png	 Where
n06-140-s05-01.png	there 's gold and women there 's always trouble , 
n06-140-s05-02.png	observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle .
n06-140-s06-00.png	He
n06-140-s06-01.png	was never long on patience .
n06-148-s00-00.png	I saw several men running down towards
n06-148-s00-01.png	the shack .
n06-148-s01-00.png	They were all armed with rifles .
n06-148-s02-00.png	As the nearest of them came round the
n06-148-s02-01.png	shack , his rifle at the ready , I saw it was Nick
n06-148-s02-02.png	Dowd , still wearing his blue check shirt .
n06-148-s03-00.png	He
n06-148-s03-01.png	came up close , eyeing us suspiciously .
n06-148-s04-00.png	 We 've
n06-148-s04-01.png	come 2a-calling , I said .
n06-148-s05-00.png	 Can't see no reason
n06-148-s05-01.png	for calling , he said .
n06-148-s06-00.png	 Still long as you 're here
n06-148-s06-01.png	you may as well stay a while .
n06-156-s00-00.png	'Light an' come on in . 
n06-156-s01-00.png	We dismounted and
n06-156-s01-01.png	one of the miners who 'd come along with
n06-156-s01-02.png	Nick Dowd took our horses off to water .
n06-156-s02-00.png	We followed Nick Dowd into the shack .
n06-156-s03-00.png	They 'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it
n06-156-s03-01.png	a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed .
n06-156-s04-00.png	Other
n06-156-s04-01.png	miners followed in at our heels .
n06-156-s05-00.png	Nick Dowd
n06-156-s05-01.png	found us a couple of boxes to sit on .
n06-163-s00-00.png	A small man in bib overalls and a battered
n06-163-s00-01.png	Derby hat fussed around the stove .
n06-163-s01-00.png	 2Ain't
n06-163-s01-01.png	exactly the Ritz Hotel but we 've got our little
n06-163-s01-02.png	comforts , said Dowd .
n06-163-s02-00.png	He introduced the men
n06-163-s02-01.png	who 'd come in as Roper Smith , Shorty , Mick
n06-163-s02-02.png	Golightly , Swede and the Sodbuster .
n06-163-s03-00.png	This last was
n06-163-s03-01.png	the little hombre in big overalls .
n06-163-s04-00.png	Very soon he
n06-163-s04-01.png	had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
n06-163-s04-02.png	sweetened with molasses for all and for us
n06-163-s04-03.png	there were two plates of beans .
n06-169-s00-00.png	 They gives you the wind , said the Sodbuster
n06-169-s00-01.png	handing them to us , but it 's all we got
n06-169-s00-02.png	as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold
n06-169-s00-03.png	dust . 
n06-169-s01-00.png	He winked at his partners .
n06-169-s02-00.png	They all
n06-169-s02-01.png	watched us as we ate the beans .
n06-169-s03-00.png	Then when
n06-169-s03-01.png	we 'd finished and I 'd rolled a cigarette
n06-169-s03-02.png	the man called Shorty said ,
n06-169-s04-00.png	 You were saying when
n06-169-s04-01.png	you came in that 2somep'n happened last
n06-169-s04-02.png	night . 
n06-175-s00-00.png	 Yes , I said .
n06-175-s01-00.png	 Something happened all right .
n06-175-s02-00.png	After you 'd left the meeting , mister - I
n06-175-s02-01.png	looked across at Nick Dowd - someone cut
n06-175-s02-02.png	down William Appleton outside the Palace
n06-175-s02-03.png	with a shotgun . 
n06-175-s03-00.png	I paused and watched my
n06-175-s03-01.png	words affect them in their different ways .
n06-175-s04-00.png	 That 's sure bad news , said Dowd , sombrely .
n06-175-s05-00.png	 It 2jest about leaves everything wide open
n06-175-s05-01.png	for Mr. Pell and his bunch , observed
n06-175-s05-02.png	Shorty .
n06-182-s00-00.png	The rest of the men there said nothing but
n06-182-s00-01.png	you could see they were hard hit .
n06-182-s01-00.png	They were
n06-182-s01-01.png	simple men who knew a lot maybe about
n06-182-s01-02.png	digging for gold but were babes in arms
n06-182-s01-03.png	when it came to dealing with owlhooters and
n06-182-s01-04.png	desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
n06-182-s01-05.png	rest .
n06-182-s02-00.png	 I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold
n06-182-s02-01.png	right 2hyar , Nick , said the Sodbuster .
n06-186-s00-00.png	 Yeah , said Dowd dubiously .
n06-186-s01-00.png	 2Mebbe we 'd
n06-186-s01-01.png	better . 
n06-186-s02-00.png	Surprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at
n06-186-s02-01.png	that point .
n06-186-s03-00.png	 If you do , he said , you 'll be
n06-186-s03-01.png	sure asking for trouble .
n06-186-s04-00.png	They 'll be on your
n06-186-s04-01.png	necks before you can say ' knife ' .
n06-186-s05-00.png	It wouldn't
n06-186-s05-01.png	be the first time they 've held up a diggings
n06-186-s05-02.png	at gun point either .
n06-186-s06-00.png	They 've done it before
n06-186-s06-01.png	and got away with it . 
n06-194-s00-00.png	 You 're 2durned tootin' , mister , said the man
n06-194-s00-01.png	called Roper Smith .
n06-194-s01-00.png	 We 've got five rifles among
n06-194-s01-01.png	us and a few six-shooters .
n06-194-s02-00.png	But most of us
n06-194-s02-01.png	2ain't 2eddicated in shootin' .
n06-194-s03-00.png	It 'd be a
n06-194-s03-01.png	2massacree , 2yessir . 
n06-194-s04-00.png	 If you 'll take a chance
n06-194-s04-01.png	on getting your gold to the bank , then we 'll
n06-194-s04-02.png	abide by what we said at the meeting , 
n06-194-s04-03.png	said Dan .
n06-194-s05-00.png	 We 'll watch the stage out of reach . 
n06-201-s00-00.png	I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
n06-201-s00-01.png	with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself
n06-201-s00-02.png	on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
n06-201-s00-03.png	handsome offer so I chimed in too .
n06-201-s01-00.png	 That
n06-201-s01-01.png	goes for me , gentlemen , I said .
n06-201-s02-00.png	 If they do try
n06-201-s02-01.png	and hold up the stage , it 'll be a couple or
n06-201-s02-02.png	three of them , no more .
n06-201-s03-00.png	I reckon we can deal
n06-201-s03-01.png	with them all right . 
p01-147-s00-00.png	Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
p01-147-s00-01.png	of the church where there was a small open
p01-147-s00-02.png	outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
p01-147-s00-03.png	and forks and tidying up implements .
p01-147-s01-00.png	It might
p01-147-s01-01.png	be open .
p01-147-s02-00.png	It was .
p01-147-s03-00.png	He entered , and seated himself
p01-147-s03-01.png	in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow .
p01-147-s04-00.png	His curious headgear fell off .
p01-147-s05-00.png	Strange things
p01-147-s05-01.png	were going on in his bewildered brain .
p01-147-s06-00.png	When
p01-147-s06-01.png	a man was drowning and towards his last
p01-147-s06-02.png	gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
p01-147-s06-03.png	life came up before him in some cinematic
p01-147-s06-04.png	kind of sequence .
p01-155-s00-00.png	Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
p01-155-s00-01.png	outbuilding , but this was happening to him now .
p01-155-s01-00.png	He
p01-155-s01-01.png	saw himself as a sulky , ugly , malformed , repressed
p01-155-s01-02.png	boy , then a young youth .
p01-155-s02-00.png	He saw himself refusing
p01-155-s02-01.png	baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to .
p01-155-s03-00.png	Walking out of the chapel later on .
p01-155-s04-00.png	Continuing
p01-155-s04-01.png	on , his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
p01-155-s04-02.png	canery and corruption , the growth of the dea-
p01-155-s04-03.png	dly decadence and absorption in debase-
p01-155-s04-04.png	ment and Satanic debauchery .
p01-168-s00-00.png	He didn't know what to make of it , but it
p01-168-s00-01.png	was Mr. Copthorne all right .
p01-168-s01-00.png	Perhaps he had
p01-168-s01-01.png	been attending some kind of fancy dress do
p01-168-s01-02.png	in London .
p01-168-s02-00.png	Very strange his eyes looked .
p01-168-s03-00.png	Mad ,
p01-168-s03-01.png	hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in
p01-168-s03-02.png	his head , so the verger described afterwards .
p01-168-s04-00.png	 You 're very early about , sir , he said , trying to
p01-168-s04-01.png	speak normally .
p01-174-s00-00.png	 Yes .
p01-174-s01-00.png	I travelled down from London
p01-174-s01-01.png	as the dawn was breaking , and
p01-174-s01-02.png	the thought came to me I 'd like
p01-174-s01-03.png	to take a look at the church .
p01-174-s02-00.png	I 've
p01-174-s02-01.png	never been inside .
p01-174-s03-00.png	Very remiss of
p01-174-s03-01.png	me , said Mr. Copthorne .
p01-174-s04-00.png	The verger
p01-174-s04-01.png	led the way in .
p01-174-s05-00.png	 The stained glass
p01-174-s05-01.png	windows , sir , they date back to
p01-174-s05-02.png	the fourteenth century . 
p02-000-s00-00.png	There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
p02-000-s00-01.png	quickly through the customs .
p02-000-s01-00.png	 Gay ! 
p02-000-s02-00.png	 Gavin ! 
p02-000-s03-00.png	The girl
p02-000-s03-01.png	and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
p02-000-s03-02.png	together .
p02-000-s04-00.png	The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
p02-000-s04-01.png	taxi .
p02-000-s05-00.png	 Just a moment , darling , Gavin pressed her
p02-000-s05-01.png	hand and smiled .
p02-000-s06-00.png	 I want to check up on the
p02-000-s06-01.png	flights back . 
p02-008-s00-00.png	Gay went out to the waiting
p02-008-s00-01.png	taxi , and then found that in
p02-008-s00-02.png	the excitement of meeting
p02-008-s00-03.png	Gavin she had left her sun-
p02-008-s00-04.png	glasses on the veranda .
p02-008-s01-00.png	She
p02-008-s01-01.png	went quickly back to fetch them .
p02-008-s02-00.png	Gavin and the girl who had got
p02-008-s02-01.png	off the plane with him were talking .
p02-008-s03-00.png	He was writing something in his
p02-008-s03-01.png	pocket-book , with a sick feeling
p02-008-s03-02.png	of despair Gay knew that of course
p02-017-s00-00.png	Gay , sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could
p02-017-s00-01.png	hardly believe that she was the same girl ,
p02-017-s00-02.png	miserable , shy , who had sat at the little
p02-017-s00-03.png	table for the first time a few days ago .
p02-017-s01-00.png	Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
p02-017-s01-01.png	and Gay's heart turned over .
p02-017-s02-00.png	 I 'd like
p02-017-s02-01.png	to do that . 
p02-017-s03-00.png	Gavin drained his glass
p02-017-s03-01.png	and refilled it .
p02-022-s00-00.png	 And then we 'll go for a stroll along the
p02-022-s00-01.png	beach .
p02-022-s01-00.png	A moon like this mustn't be wasted . 
p02-022-s02-00.png	He gestured towards the bay where the full
p02-022-s02-01.png	moon was just rising over the rocks , then
p02-022-s02-02.png	laid his hand on hers .
p02-022-s03-00.png	Gay smiled at him
p02-022-s03-01.png	again , happy beyond belief , knowing that
p02-022-s03-02.png	now Gavin was in love with her and her
p02-022-s03-03.png	only , yet remembering for a second the
p02-022-s03-04.png	kisses she had seen him giving Elaine .
p02-027-s00-00.png	All that was part of the past , she would put it behind her .
p02-027-s01-00.png	She
p02-027-s01-01.png	would never be jealous again , would even take Larry's advice and
p02-027-s01-02.png	look the other way if need be .
p02-027-s02-00.png	 I say ! 
p02-027-s03-00.png	Gavin was looking over her
p02-027-s03-01.png	shoulder .
p02-027-s04-00.png	 That 's a pretty girl ! 
p02-027-s05-00.png	Gay glanced behind her ,
p02-027-s06-00.png	 Isn't she
p02-027-s06-01.png	lovely , she 's French , a very well known model I believe .
p02-069-s00-00.png	Gay , a little puzzled , went through
p02-069-s00-01.png	to the bar .
p02-069-s01-00.png	Doc and Lilyan were
p02-069-s01-01.png	sitting just inside having coffee .
p02-069-s02-00.png	 Come and join us and bring your
p02-069-s02-01.png	boy friend , Doc called .
p02-069-s03-00.png	 No , Doc ! 
p02-069-s03-01.png	Lilyan remonstrated .
p02-069-s04-00.png	 They want to be
p02-069-s04-01.png	alone . 
p02-069-s05-00.png	 I 've booked a table at the
p02-069-s05-01.png	cafe*?2 , Doc said , they are packed
p02-069-s05-02.png	tonight so come and join us if you
p02-069-s05-03.png	can't find a table for two . 
p02-076-s00-00.png	Gay thanked him and walked out on to
p02-076-s00-01.png	the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
p02-076-s00-02.png	had bought a drink and taken it outside .
p02-076-s01-00.png	She looked round scanning the tables ,
p02-076-s01-01.png	then caught her breath , a cold hand
p02-076-s01-02.png	seeming to clutch her heart .
p02-076-s02-00.png	Gavin was
p02-076-s02-01.png	seated at a small table in a shadowy
p02-076-s02-02.png	corner talking animatedly to Simone .
p02-076-s03-00.png	As Gay watched he offered the girl a
p02-076-s03-01.png	cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
p02-076-s03-02.png	hers in an intimate way .
p02-081-s00-00.png	Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
p02-081-s00-01.png	decided to go back and join Lilyan and
p02-081-s00-02.png	Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
p02-081-s00-03.png	run upstairs to her room , knowing that
p02-081-s00-04.png	Gavin although he had told her that he
p02-081-s00-05.png	loved her , was already flirting with a girl
p02-081-s00-06.png	that he had only met a few minutes before .
p02-081-s01-00.png	Larry's advice flashed through her mind ,
p02-081-s01-01.png	but she turned away , giving a little
p02-081-s01-02.png	gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
p02-090-s00-00.png	The others were all dancing and
p02-090-s00-01.png	as Gay drew out a chair and sat
p02-090-s00-02.png	down Gavin , without a word , swept
p02-090-s00-03.png	Simone on to the floor .
p02-090-s01-00.png	 It doesn't mean
p02-090-s01-01.png	anything , Gay told herself desperately ,
p02-090-s01-02.png	trying to understand Gavin's point of
p02-090-s01-03.png	view and remembering the advice
p02-090-s01-04.png	that Larry had given her , while she
p02-090-s01-05.png	felt wretched beyond words .
p02-101-s00-00.png	His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
p02-101-s00-01.png	taste but it was unkind beyond words .
p02-101-s01-00.png	She fumbled
p02-101-s01-01.png	with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
p02-101-s01-02.png	not wanting to smoke but needing some action
p02-101-s01-03.png	to help her control her feelings .
p02-101-s02-00.png	 Come and
p02-101-s02-01.png	dance , Doc's cheery voice came as a
p02-101-s02-02.png	lifeline and Gay got up quickly , mana-
p02-101-s02-03.png	ging a smile .
p02-105-s00-00.png	As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
p02-105-s00-01.png	and Simone go through the doorway that led
p02-105-s00-02.png	down to the beach .
p02-105-s01-00.png	Gay closed her eyes for a
p02-105-s01-01.png	moment in disgust .
p02-105-s02-00.png	She was fully aware that Gavin
p02-105-s02-01.png	would make love to the French girl on the sands ,
p02-105-s02-02.png	and no doubt he would come back soon and
p02-105-s02-03.png	after Simone had left expect her to accept his
p02-105-s02-04.png	kisses on the way back to the hotel .
p02-109-s00-00.png	Sentence Database P02-109
p02-109-s00-01.png	-----------------------------------------------------
p02-109-s01-00.png	 And that 's the man whom you have been eating your
p02-109-s01-01.png	heart out over ? 
p02-109-s02-00.png	Doc nodded towards the door .
p02-109-s03-00.png	 You
p02-109-s03-01.png	may consider him a man , I would say he was a
p02-109-s03-02.png	mentally adolescent cad . 
p02-109-s04-00.png	 Oh , Doc ... Gay protested
p02-109-s04-01.png	weakly , you don't know Gavin . 
p02-109-s05-00.png	 I 've only met him
p02-109-s05-01.png	today but I think I can safely say that I know
p02-109-s05-02.png	him a great deal better than you do . 
p02-115-s00-00.png	Doc gave her hand a shake .
p02-115-s01-00.png	 Wake up
p02-115-s01-01.png	Gay , and don't even contemplate throwing
p02-115-s01-02.png	yourself away on a chap like that .
p02-115-s02-00.png	You 're a
p02-115-s02-01.png	fine girl , intelligent , and pretty , and I had
p02-115-s02-02.png	thought you were sensible too .
p02-115-s03-00.png	Don't
p02-115-s03-01.png	make a fool of yourself over someone
p02-115-s03-02.png	who doesn't care two jots for your feelings .
p02-115-s04-00.png	If he behaves like this now what is your
p02-115-s04-01.png	married life going to be like ?
p02-121-s00-00.png	Hell . 
p02-121-s01-00.png	Doc answered for her .
p02-121-s02-00.png	 Just Hell .
p02-121-s03-00.png	Never able to
p02-121-s03-01.png	trust him out of your sight and having to put on
p02-121-s03-02.png	a brave face and pretend that you don't mind
p02-121-s03-03.png	whenever he flirts with another woman .
p02-121-s04-00.png	He will
p02-121-s04-01.png	you know , always , and you aren't the type
p02-121-s04-02.png	who is tough enough to change him . 
p02-127-s00-00.png	Gay nodded .
p02-127-s01-00.png	 I know that you 're right Doc , I think
p02-127-s01-01.png	now that I do realise that , and in any case , she added
p02-127-s01-02.png	a little sadly , if I did change Gavin , he wouldn't
p02-127-s01-03.png	be the same , if you know what I mean . 
p02-127-s02-00.png	 You sound
p02-127-s02-01.png	like Alice in Wonderland , Doc gently mocked her , and
p02-127-s02-02.png	I 'm glad you 're beginning to see that you 're wasting
p02-127-s02-03.png	your time on that chap .
p02-131-s00-00.png	Now let him go and you won't have to wait
p02-131-s00-01.png	long for the right man for you to come
p02-131-s00-02.png	along .
p02-131-s01-00.png	If I was thirty years younger and weren't
p02-131-s01-01.png	married to the sweetest wife in the world
p02-131-s01-02.png	I 'd marry you myself . 
p02-131-s02-00.png	Gay laughed , Doc was
p02-131-s02-01.png	so kind and nice and she hoped that one
p02-131-s02-02.png	day she would be able to see the situation
p02-131-s02-03.png	as it obviously appeared to everyone else .
p02-135-s00-00.png	Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
p02-135-s00-01.png	again Gay found herself alone at the table
p02-135-s00-02.png	feeling self-conscious and awkward , sure that
p02-135-s00-03.png	people were talking about the way Gavin
p02-135-s00-04.png	was behaving since they had seen them
p02-135-s00-05.png	dining together .
p02-135-s01-00.png	She opened her bag
p02-135-s01-01.png	to get out her compact and saw Grace's
p02-135-s01-02.png	letter .
p02-135-s02-00.png	She drew it out and opened it ,
p02-135-s02-01.png	glad to be able to occupy herself .
p02-139-s00-00.png	 So glad that you are having such a lovely time , dearie , 
p02-139-s00-01.png	it ran .
p02-139-s01-00.png	 Your cards are lovely .
p02-139-s02-00.png	I rang up Miss Harland
p02-139-s02-01.png	and have been over to sit with her father and do what
p02-139-s02-02.png	I can for him so that she can get out to do her shopping .
p02-139-s03-00.png	He 's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his
p02-139-s03-01.png	broken arm .
p02-144-s00-00.png	No other news except that Elaine is engaged
p02-144-s00-01.png	and going to marry a foreigner ... 
p02-144-s01-00.png	Gay read the rest of the letter then put
p02-144-s01-01.png	it back in her bag .
p02-144-s02-00.png	Elaine was engaged ,
p02-144-s02-01.png	to the man she had spent so much time
p02-144-s02-02.png	with at her party .
p02-144-s03-00.png	That was why
p02-144-s03-01.png	Gavin had come back to her .
p02-144-s04-00.png	Everything was quite clear now , and to
p02-144-s04-01.png	her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak ,
p02-144-s04-02.png	rather a sense of relief now that she
p02-144-s04-03.png	knew why Gavin had come to see
p02-144-s04-04.png	her .
p02-150-s00-00.png	Because she was second best .
p02-150-s01-00.png	The others came back
p02-150-s01-01.png	to the table , all of them making a fuss of her and at once
p02-150-s01-02.png	she felt happier .
p02-150-s02-00.png	Gay loved them for their warm sympathy ,
p02-150-s02-01.png	knowing that they were real friends , even if they were new ones .
p02-150-s03-00.png	 That is a pretty dress , Lilyan commented , obviously sensing
p02-150-s03-01.png	Gay's distress and in a way that Doc , as a man , could not
p02-150-s03-02.png	understand , knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
p02-150-s03-03.png	for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
p02-150-s03-04.png	was hurt for herself .
p02-155-s00-00.png	 I made it myself , Gay tried to speak
p02-155-s00-01.png	normally .
p03-004-s00-00.png	Diana Wills often sat on the brand
p03-004-s00-01.png	new seat outside the hospital
p03-004-s00-02.png	gates and thought vagrant
p03-004-s00-03.png	thoughts .
p03-004-s01-00.png	At one time she had
p03-004-s01-01.png	watched the workmen constructing
p03-004-s01-02.png	the roundabout , which was
p03-004-s01-03.png	to put St. John's Casualty Department
p03-004-s01-04.png	out of operation - in theory , at
p03-004-s01-05.png	least .
p03-004-s02-00.png	She would think of her-
p03-004-s02-01.png	self as a stranger in these parts
p03-004-s02-02.png	studying these cross-roads .
p03-004-s03-00.png	Which
p03-004-s03-01.png	one to take ?
p03-009-s00-00.png	 If I were a tramp I would simply blow a
p03-009-s00-01.png	feather , she decided , rather envying the gentle-
p03-009-s00-02.png	man of the road his freedom of decision , and
p03-009-s00-03.png	wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded
p03-009-s00-04.png	women doctors to blow a feather and follow its
p03-009-s00-05.png	airy directions accordingly .
p03-009-s01-00.png	 If I were needing a
p03-009-s01-01.png	job I 'd go to London , of course , she went on .
p03-012-s00-00.png	 There are all sorts of wonder-
p03-012-s00-01.png	ful jobs in London and I could
p03-012-s00-02.png	take my pick , whereas in Yarmouth
p03-012-s00-03.png	one has to know something about fishing
p03-012-s00-04.png	and in Liverpool they 'd want sea-farers .
p03-012-s01-00.png	I don't think I 'd go to Edinburgh un-
p03-012-s01-01.png	less I was a Scot and wanting to get
p03-012-s01-02.png	home , or perhaps a student studying to
p03-012-s01-03.png	be a doctor , and I already know
p03-012-s01-04.png	all about that . 
p03-023-s00-00.png	She was engaged to Nigel , had been for two years .
p03-023-s01-00.png	Sometimes they talked on the theme of when we get married ,
p03-023-s01-01.png	and then all was wonderful , and perhaps it had only been
p03-023-s01-02.png	a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said , only last
p03-023-s01-03.png	evening ,
p03-023-s02-00.png	 If we get married , old girl , you 'll have to stop
p03-023-s02-01.png	that lark , I can tell you ! 
p03-027-s00-00.png	She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
p03-027-s00-01.png	which ' lark ' she would have to stop , only that significant tiny
p03-027-s00-02.png	word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and
p03-027-s00-03.png	with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information ,
p03-027-s00-04.png	which now took on an ominous significance : Nigel had been
p03-027-s00-05.png	seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
p03-027-s00-06.png	been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
p03-027-s00-07.png	Little Phelpham .
p03-029-s00-00.png	Now Nigel had every right to go where he
p03-029-s00-01.png	liked during his off-duty periods
p03-029-s00-02.png	when she was not free ; this much they had
p03-029-s00-03.png	conceded one to the other .
p03-029-s01-00.png	They rarely
p03-029-s01-01.png	found they were off duty together , and
p03-029-s01-02.png	the situation would have been intolerable
p03-029-s01-03.png	had there not been some give and take
p03-029-s01-04.png	about their relationship .
p03-029-s02-00.png	So when Nigel
p03-029-s02-01.png	had told her about taking Luke's
p03-029-s02-02.png	evening surgery she had said ,
p03-033-s00-00.png	 Bless you !
p03-033-s01-00.png	I hope Luke is suitably grateful , darling . 
p03-033-s02-00.png	 Oh , well , 
p03-033-s02-01.png	he shrugged diffidently , I like the work .
p03-033-s03-00.png	One gets plenty
p03-033-s03-01.png	of variety and it 's a change . 
p03-033-s04-00.png	Nigel was the hospital's
p03-033-s04-01.png	Junior Medical Officer .
p03-033-s05-00.png	 You won't be free about nine , I
p03-033-s05-01.png	suppose , to meet me for supper somewhere ? she had
p03-033-s05-02.png	asked hopefully .
p03-040-s00-00.png	 Hardly likely , my sweet .
p03-040-s01-00.png	Luke's surgery goes on for
p03-040-s01-01.png	hours .
p03-040-s02-00.png	If they get in before eight-thirty , even
p03-040-s02-01.png	though they 're standing on one another's toes ,
p03-040-s02-02.png	I 've got to see 'em .
p03-040-s03-00.png	If I am free , though ,
p03-040-s03-01.png	I 'll give you a ring , O.K. ? 
p03-040-s04-00.png	O.K. , she had
p03-040-s04-01.png	replied readily .
p03-040-s05-00.png	So how could Nigel have
p03-040-s05-01.png	been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse ,
p03-040-s05-02.png	dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
p03-040-s05-03.png	very evening ?
p03-047-s00-00.png	 No , she told Phil Gubbins , a junior
p03-047-s00-01.png	houseman , it wasn't Nigel you saw ,
p03-047-s00-02.png	my lad . 
p03-047-s01-00.png	 It was Nigel's car , anyway .
p03-047-s02-00.png	NUF 121 . 
p03-047-s03-00.png	 He probably loaned his car
p03-047-s03-01.png	to somebody , Phil .
p03-047-s04-00.png	He 's always doing that . 
p03-047-s05-00.png	Young Gubbins shrugged .
p03-047-s06-00.png	 I didn't see his
p03-047-s06-01.png	face , Di , but it certainly looked like
p03-047-s06-02.png	Nigel from the back .
p03-047-s07-00.png	D.j. and all .
p03-047-s08-00.png	Of course such as I couldn't afford
p03-047-s08-01.png	to go into the Load of Trouble . 
p03-057-s00-00.png	 Neither can Nigel , smiled Diana .
p03-057-s01-00.png	 He 's saving up to get married .
p03-057-s02-00.png	Remember ? 
p03-057-s03-00.png	 I remember , quipped the houseman ,
p03-057-s03-01.png	meaning no offence , but does he ?
p03-057-s04-00.png	That blonde was something . 
p03-057-s05-00.png	 Anybody
p03-057-s05-01.png	I know ? she smiled .
p03-057-s06-00.png	 I think so .
p03-057-s07-00.png	I got a good look at her .
p03-057-s08-00.png	But if Nigel
p03-057-s08-01.png	wasn't there it isn't important , is it ? 
p03-057-s09-00.png	 No , Di said immediately .
p03-057-s10-00.png	 It isn't at
p03-057-s10-01.png	all important . 
p03-069-s00-00.png	But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
p03-069-s00-01.png	realised it was important enough for her to have remembered , and it
p03-069-s00-02.png	was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
p03-069-s00-03.png	made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead .
p03-069-s01-00.png	 Nigel , she had besought him , you know that evening
p03-069-s01-01.png	you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman
p03-069-s01-02.png	with a cyst on her ear ... ? 
p03-072-s00-00.png	 5Ye-es ? he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
p03-072-s00-01.png	mouth , an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge .
p03-072-s01-00.png	 What about it , my sweet ? 
p03-072-s02-00.png	 Well , she laughed
p03-072-s02-01.png	suddenly in an upsurging of relief , that stupid
p03-072-s02-02.png	Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble .
p03-072-s03-00.png	With a blonde , too .
p03-072-s04-00.png	Imagine ! 
p03-072-s05-00.png	Nigel was frowning .
p03-072-s06-00.png	He
p03-072-s06-01.png	looked distinguished when he frowned ; boyishly
p03-072-s06-02.png	handsome at other times .
p03-080-s00-00.png	 Gubbins ?
p03-080-s01-00.png	Gubbins ? he fretted .
p03-080-s02-00.png	 Who 's he ? 
p03-080-s03-00.png	Though Diana knew the name of every
p03-080-s03-01.png	member of the staff , distinguished or not ,
p03-080-s03-02.png	Nigel often had to think hard to sort
p03-080-s03-03.png	them out .
p03-080-s04-00.png	 He 's the carrotty lad , isn't he ? 
p03-080-s04-01.png	he now demanded .
p03-080-s05-00.png	 What was he
p03-080-s05-01.png	doing at the Load of Trouble ? 
p03-087-s00-00.png	 Oh , he wasn't .
p03-087-s01-00.png	His motor-bike had
p03-087-s01-01.png	broken down outside and he noticed
p03-087-s01-02.png	your car and then you dancing with
p03-087-s01-03.png	this blonde . 
p03-087-s02-00.png	 Really ? Nigel cocked
p03-087-s02-01.png	one eyebrow .
p03-087-s03-00.png	 Actually she was brunette
p03-087-s03-01.png	at the roots and I had a redhead on
p03-087-s03-02.png	the other arm .
p03-087-s04-00.png	He would have told
p03-087-s04-01.png	you this , too ? 
p03-087-s05-00.png	 No , she laughed .
p03-087-s06-00.png	 He didn't actually see you .
p03-087-s07-00.png	Because
p03-087-s07-01.png	it was your car I suppose he
p03-087-s07-02.png	presumed it was you , all dressed up in
p03-096-s00-00.png	 My white or my black ? Nigel enquired .
p03-096-s01-00.png	 Now I wonder which I wore at that
p03-096-s01-01.png	particular surgery ? 
p03-096-s02-00.png	 You are a fool ,
p03-096-s02-01.png	darling , Di said happily .
p03-096-s03-00.png	 I shall take
p03-096-s03-01.png	great pleasure in telling that young man
p03-096-s03-02.png	exactly what you were doing that
p03-096-s03-03.png	evening . 
p03-096-s04-00.png	 No , don't , he said , after
p03-096-s04-01.png	kissing her again .
p03-096-s05-00.png	 I rather like to have
p03-096-s05-01.png	the housemen think of me as a
p03-096-s05-02.png	two-timing Don Juan .
p03-103-s00-00.png	I 'm such a dull fellow , really . 
p03-103-s01-00.png	 Dull ? 
p03-103-s02-00.png	She
p03-103-s02-01.png	couldn't believe it .
p03-103-s03-00.png	Self-deprecation
p03-103-s03-01.png	was not one of Nigel's usual attributes .
p03-103-s04-00.png	 You need your holiday , darling .
p03-103-s05-00.png	I only
p03-103-s05-01.png	wish I could go with you ! 
p03-103-s06-00.png	 Doctor
p03-103-s06-01.png	Wills , if you 're making improper suggestions ... ? 
p03-103-s07-00.png	 It would make me more interesting ,
p03-103-s07-01.png	I suppose ? she enquired archly .
p03-112-s00-00.png	 No , it wouldn't ! he almost snapped ,
p03-112-s00-01.png	surprising her .
p03-112-s01-00.png	 You sounded like some-
p03-112-s01-01.png	body else for a moment there .
p03-112-s02-00.png	It doesn't
p03-112-s02-01.png	become you to behave like a - a tart , Di . 
p03-112-s03-00.png	 Nigel - ! she gasped .
p03-112-s04-00.png	 I didn't mean to
p03-112-s04-01.png	behave like anything of the kind .
p03-112-s05-00.png	I
p03-112-s05-01.png	was only joking . 
p03-112-s06-00.png	 Well , don't .
p03-112-s07-00.png	It 's
p03-112-s07-01.png	miserable enough my having to take my
p03-112-s07-02.png	leave in the autumn without you
p03-112-s07-03.png	trying to be bright and gay about it .
p03-121-s00-00.png	I 'm going with a shooting party .
p03-121-s01-00.png	What else can I do
p03-121-s01-01.png	at this time of year ?
p03-121-s02-00.png	I can't ask you up because it 's
p03-121-s02-01.png	a strictly stag affair . 
p03-121-s03-00.png	 I know .
p03-121-s04-00.png	I didn't expect ... 
p03-121-s05-00.png	 Well ,
p03-121-s05-01.png	don't keep hinting , then .
p03-121-s06-00.png	You wish you could
p03-121-s06-01.png	come with me ; you hope I 'll miss you ; you
p03-121-s06-02.png	can't imagine the hospital without me for
p03-121-s06-03.png	three weeks , etcetera , etcetera ! 
p03-135-s00-00.png	Her figure was small and exquisite , like a schoolgirl's still , and
p03-135-s00-01.png	he admired her legs , which the male sex were inclined to
p03-135-s00-02.png	regard first .
p03-135-s01-00.png	 I would mind if you didn't he told her
p03-135-s01-01.png	grimly , and tugged her fiercely into his arms .
p03-135-s02-00.png	 You 're
p03-135-s02-01.png	right , pet .
p03-135-s03-00.png	I do need this leave .
p03-135-s04-00.png	I 'm bad-tempered and
p03-135-s04-01.png	broody and going out with brash blondes .
p03-135-s05-00.png	I don't deserve
p03-135-s05-01.png	you . 
p03-142-s00-00.png	 Darling ! her voiced caressed him .
p03-142-s01-00.png	 Moments like this
p03-142-s01-01.png	make all the waiting worth while .
p03-142-s02-00.png	When we 're
p03-142-s02-01.png	married we won't have these explosions of emotion ,
p03-142-s02-02.png	will we ? 
p03-142-s03-00.png	 No , he eyed her strangely .
p03-142-s04-00.png	 I wish we
p03-142-s04-01.png	were married , Di .
p03-142-s05-00.png	Like a patient wishes his operation
p03-142-s05-01.png	was over . 
p03-142-s06-00.png	Again her laughter trilled .
p03-142-s07-00.png	 Marriage
p03-142-s07-01.png	isn't as bad as an operation , Nigel ! 
p03-151-s00-00.png	 Isn't it ? he rose and smoothed himself
p03-151-s00-01.png	down .
p03-151-s01-00.png	 Ask any bridegroom-to-be .
p03-151-s02-00.png	Anyhow ,
p03-151-s02-01.png	that particular problem isn't looming at
p03-151-s02-02.png	the moment , thank God ! 
p03-151-s03-00.png	Problem ... ?
p03-151-s03-01.png	looming ... ?
p03-151-s04-00.png	 Are we discussing a marriage
p03-151-s04-01.png	or a burial ? she asked , hardly believing
p03-151-s04-02.png	he could be serious .
p03-151-s05-00.png	 Surely marrying
p03-151-s05-01.png	me isn't going to be all that bad ?
p03-158-s00-00.png	If it is - she laughed uncertainly - you can have
p03-158-s00-01.png	your ring back . 
p03-158-s01-00.png	She loosened the half-hoop of
p03-158-s01-01.png	diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it
p03-158-s01-02.png	out to him , still playfully .
p03-158-s02-00.png	Without a glimmer
p03-158-s02-01.png	of amusement in his own eyes , however , he took
p03-158-s02-02.png	it , looking moodily beyond her .
p03-158-s03-00.png	 Perhaps it 's as
p03-158-s03-01.png	well if you don't wear it for a bit , Di , he
p03-158-s03-02.png	told her .
p03-163-s00-00.png	 But I want it ! she protested .
p03-163-s01-00.png	 It 's my ring . 
p03-163-s02-00.png	 You just gave it back to me . 
p03-163-s03-00.png	 I
p03-163-s03-01.png	didn't !
p03-163-s04-00.png	I was joking .
p03-163-s05-00.png	You know I was
p03-163-s05-01.png	joking , Nigel . 
p03-163-s06-00.png	 You shouldn't joke
p03-163-s06-01.png	about serious things like engagements . 
p03-163-s07-00.png	 Don't be such a baby ! 
p03-163-s08-00.png	They were going
p03-163-s08-01.png	to have an open quarrel
p03-163-s08-02.png	any minute , and she knew it .
p03-173-s00-00.png	Almost in desperation she appealed ,
p03-173-s01-00.png	 Will you meet
p03-173-s01-01.png	me at the gate , four o'clock tomorrow ? 
p03-173-s02-00.png	 Why ? he
p03-173-s02-01.png	enquired , combing his thick , tawny hair .
p03-173-s03-00.png	 To bring
p03-173-s03-01.png	me up for tea , of course .
p03-173-s04-00.png	I just thought . 
p03-173-s05-00.png	 I 'll see , 
p03-173-s05-01.png	he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace
p03-173-s05-02.png	which really hurt .
p03-173-s06-00.png	 Without your ring it 's just like
p03-173-s06-01.png	kissing somebody else's girl , he decided wickedly ,
p03-173-s06-02.png	and kissed her again , somewhat startled to
p03-173-s06-03.png	receive a sharp slap for his pains .
p03-181-s00-00.png	 If I were somebody else's girl that 's
p03-181-s00-01.png	what you 'd get , she flashed at him , and
p03-181-s00-02.png	so had left him , on her dignity and not
p03-181-s00-03.png	seeing the look of admiration and revelation
p03-181-s00-04.png	which had followed her slim young figure
p03-181-s00-05.png	out of his sight .
p03-181-s01-00.png	 Mine , Nigel Lester had
p03-181-s01-01.png	decided with a sigh of satisfaction , and
p03-181-s01-02.png	then regarded the ring which he retrieved
p03-181-s01-03.png	from his pocket .
p03-181-s02-00.png	 At a price , he concluded ,
p03-181-s02-01.png	with some bitterness .
p03-185-s00-00.png	Thus had they parted the previous evening and now
p03-185-s00-01.png	Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital
p03-185-s00-02.png	alone .
p03-185-s01-00.png	Of course one couldn't say for certain when a
p03-185-s01-01.png	doctor would be free during the day ; tea was served
p03-185-s01-02.png	from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-
p03-185-s01-03.png	room , which proved the elasticity of medical commitments .
p03-185-s02-00.png	Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention ,
p03-185-s02-01.png	she was convinced , or he would have granted her small request
p03-185-s02-02.png	to be met at the gates .
p03-189-s00-00.png	Sentence Database P03-189
p03-189-s01-00.png	They often had such a rendezvous , for
p03-189-s01-01.png	there was just time to smoke a cigarette ,
p03-189-s01-02.png	if one walked slowly , between road and
p03-189-s01-03.png	hospital .
p06-030-s00-00.png	His mouth hardened , his eyes became
p06-030-s00-01.png	steely .
p06-030-s01-00.png	' I see . '
p06-030-s02-00.png	Scorn lashed his
p06-030-s02-01.png	words .
p06-030-s03-00.png	' I wonder you dared trust
p06-030-s03-01.png	him to my care . '
p06-030-s04-00.png	' Nicholas - '
p06-030-s05-00.png	' Well !
p06-030-s06-00.png	At least I know the truth .
p06-030-s07-00.png	Truth ! '
p06-030-s08-00.png	His gaze held hers
p06-030-s08-01.png	masterfully .
p06-030-s09-00.png	' You wanted it so
p06-030-s09-01.png	badly - at any price .
p06-030-s10-00.png	I hope
p06-030-s10-01.png	you are satisfied . '
p06-042-s00-00.png	And as he spoke , the thought
p06-042-s00-01.png	of Philip lying in the other
p06-042-s00-02.png	room filled him with a re-
p06-042-s00-03.png	vulsion that was homicidal .
p06-042-s01-00.png	Even in that , his hands were
p06-042-s01-01.png	tied .
p06-042-s02-00.png	He dare not precipitate
p06-042-s02-01.png	what might well be another
p06-042-s02-02.png	coronary .
p06-042-s03-00.png	And in that second
p06-042-s03-01.png	he put back his professional
p06-042-s03-02.png	mantle , and said with such
p06-042-s03-03.png	icy politeness , such withdrawn
p06-047-s00-00.png	' I will leave you the necessary pre-
p06-047-s00-01.png	scription for the sedatives .
p06-047-s01-00.png	You
p06-047-s01-01.png	will contact your new doctor
p06-047-s01-02.png	when you reach your parents'
p06-047-s01-03.png	house . '
p06-047-s02-00.png	She watched him flick
p06-047-s02-01.png	his fountain-pen from his
p06-047-s02-02.png	waistcoat pocket , take out
p06-047-s02-03.png	his # prescription pad , and
p06-047-s02-04.png	# scribble on it .
p06-047-s03-00.png	Then ,
p06-047-s03-01.png	with a gesture she knew so well ,
p06-047-s03-02.png	he tore off the leaflet and
p06-052-s00-00.png	' Good-bye , Sandra , ' he said
p06-052-s00-01.png	with a deadly finality .
p06-052-s01-00.png	Watching
p06-052-s01-01.png	him go , unable to speak , she
p06-052-s01-02.png	felt that part of her was leaving
p06-052-s01-03.png	him .
p06-052-s02-00.png	She couldn't hate him ...
p06-052-s03-00.png	If only he would have con-
p06-052-s03-01.png	fided in her , given some expla-
p06-052-s03-02.png	nation .
p06-052-s04-00.png	Now there was no-
p06-052-s04-01.png	thing - not even friendship .
p06-058-s00-00.png	She went back to Philip .
p06-058-s01-00.png	But
p06-058-s01-01.png	all she could hear were Nicholas's
p06-058-s01-02.png	words :
p06-058-s02-00.png	' I love you - oh , you
p06-058-s02-01.png	know that well enough . '
p06-058-s03-00.png	Love .
p06-058-s04-00.png	She revolted against
p06-058-s04-01.png	the word .
p06-058-s05-00.png	Nicholas , Philip ...
p06-058-s05-01.png	where was happiness , or
p06-058-s05-02.png	peace of mind ?
p06-058-s06-00.png	Philip put out
p06-058-s06-01.png	a hand and grasped hers .
p06-058-s07-00.png	He needed her .
p06-058-s08-00.png	She would find
p06-058-s08-01.png	solace in that fact at least .
p06-069-s00-00.png	She had her truth .
p06-069-s01-00.png	How much had built
p06-069-s01-01.png	up from that first ideal , and how
p06-069-s01-02.png	little joy , or satisfaction , it had
p06-069-s01-03.png	given her .
p06-069-s02-00.png	' I 'm sorry , darling . '
p06-069-s03-00.png	He looked nervous .
p06-069-s04-00.png	It had been
p06-069-s04-01.png	hell lying there , knowing she was
p06-069-s04-02.png	talking to Nicholas and wondering
p06-069-s04-03.png	what they were saying .
p06-069-s05-00.png	Sandra
p06-069-s05-01.png	said instinctively :
p06-069-s06-00.png	' I told him
p06-069-s06-01.png	I knew he was responsible for
p06-069-s06-02.png	Beryl's death . '
p06-088-s00-00.png	Her eyes darkened in torment .
p06-088-s01-00.png	' Are
p06-088-s01-01.png	you sure that she was telling the truth ? '
p06-088-s02-00.png	' Good heavens , darling , why on earth
p06-088-s02-01.png	should she lie ?
p06-088-s03-00.png	Besides , it wasn't just
p06-088-s03-01.png	her word .
p06-088-s04-00.png	There was enough evidence ,
p06-088-s04-01.png	no matter how one might want to
p06-088-s04-02.png	disbelieve the facts . '
p06-088-s05-00.png	Elation
p06-088-s05-01.png	touched him after the cold wind
p06-088-s05-02.png	of suspense .
p06-088-s06-00.png	' It will be interesting
p06-088-s06-01.png	to see what comes out at the inquest .
p06-096-s00-00.png	What his story will be .
p06-096-s01-00.png	I reckon
p06-096-s01-01.png	he 'll confine himself to the nervous
p06-096-s01-02.png	origin of her recent illness .
p06-096-s02-00.png	His notes
p06-096-s02-01.png	will be truthful , but what he leaves out
p06-096-s02-02.png	will matter most . '
p06-096-s03-00.png	Strange how just
p06-096-s03-01.png	then Philip was so certain that Nicholas
p06-096-s03-02.png	would never betray him .
p06-096-s04-00.png	He loved
p06-096-s04-01.png	Sandra too deeply to ruin her
p06-096-s04-02.png	future happiness .
p06-096-s05-00.png	Had ever circum-
p06-096-s05-01.png	stances conspired so cunningly ?
p06-096-s06-00.png	Philip's spirits soared .
p06-104-s00-00.png	He was better ; he had made a
p06-104-s00-01.png	miraculous recovery and Sandra would
p06-104-s00-02.png	soon be his wife .
p06-104-s01-00.png	The Devil , he thought ,
p06-104-s01-01.png	certainly looked after his own .
p06-104-s02-00.png	Something in Sandra's attitude struck
p06-104-s02-01.png	him suddenly , making him say :
p06-104-s03-00.png	' You can't forgive him for this -
p06-104-s03-01.png	can you ? '
p06-104-s04-00.png	' Forgive is an unctuous ,
p06-104-s04-01.png	patronizing word , ' she replied .
p06-104-s05-00.png	' I despise
p06-104-s05-01.png	the deceit .
p06-104-s06-00.png	The lies . '
p06-242-s00-00.png	Philip bristled .
p06-242-s01-00.png	' It was never our intention
p06-242-s01-01.png	to have one of those carnival affairs , ' he
p06-242-s01-02.png	retorted and in that second , he became the man of
p06-242-s01-03.png	success exerting authority .
p06-242-s02-00.png	Sandra watched her father's
p06-242-s02-01.png	face pale .
p06-242-s03-00.png	Philip , she knew , got on his nerves , but
p06-242-s03-01.png	everything had gone over her head .
p06-242-s04-00.png	It didn't really
p06-242-s04-01.png	matter what was being said because she was
p06-242-s04-02.png	no longer a part of it .
p06-248-s00-00.png	The thought of Nicholas haunted her , the sense of
p06-248-s00-01.png	loss crucifying .
p06-248-s01-00.png	Her father's comment roused her as
p06-248-s01-01.png	he said ,
p06-248-s02-00.png	' I was not talking of a carnival .
p06-248-s03-00.png	But I
p06-248-s03-01.png	presume we shall be allowed to have one or two
p06-248-s03-02.png	of our friends at the ceremony . '
r02-000-s00-00.png	He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions
r02-000-s00-01.png	drawn between ordinary wage-earners and those
r02-000-s00-02.png	self-employed .
r02-000-s01-00.png	By the time his monthly salary
r02-000-s01-01.png	arrived , the Inland Revenue had already taken
r02-000-s01-02.png	their share , and there were precious few
r02-000-s01-03.png	reductions in tax save for wives , children ,
r02-000-s01-04.png	life-insurances or any of the other normal
r02-000-s01-05.png	encumbrances which Cecil had so far avoided .
r02-003-s00-00.png	He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the
r02-003-s00-01.png	provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her
r02-003-s00-02.png	to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases , but also
r02-003-s00-03.png	postponed demanding the tax until her financial year
r02-003-s00-04.png	was ended , audited and agreed by the Inspector .
r02-003-s01-00.png	The
r02-003-s01-01.png	process could , and often did take several years .
r02-006-s00-00.png	At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake
r02-006-s00-01.png	had claimed tax relief on the pur-
r02-006-s00-02.png	chase of several mink coats which ,
r02-006-s00-03.png	it seemed , were necessary to fur-
r02-006-s00-04.png	ther her career .
r02-006-s01-00.png	Alternatively , it
r02-006-s01-01.png	was reported , she tearfully claimed
r02-006-s01-02.png	that the warm coats were heating
r02-006-s01-03.png	appliances and therefore susceptible
r02-006-s01-04.png	to a depreciation tax allowance
r02-006-s01-05.png	as plant and machinery .
r02-006-s02-00.png	The
r02-010-s00-00.png	Between all the interested parties , the final
r02-010-s00-01.png	agreement had been delayed long enough for
r02-010-s00-02.png	Miss Cheesecake to spend all the money which
r02-010-s00-03.png	by rights should have been reserved for her tax .
r02-010-s01-00.png	Discounting one chinchilla jacket , a Rolls-
r02-010-s01-01.png	Royce and a Sussex manor house , all
r02-010-s01-02.png	three of which were in her husband's name ,
r02-010-s01-03.png	she now declared herself bankrupt .
r02-013-s00-00.png	The train drew into another station
r02-013-s00-01.png	and Cecil , with a further six stops
r02-013-s00-02.png	to go , was left almost alone in the
r02-013-s00-03.png	coach .
r02-013-s01-00.png	He fumed as he recol-
r02-013-s01-01.png	lected the long correspondence he
r02-013-s01-02.png	had had with the Inland Reve-
r02-013-s01-03.png	nue in an effort to obtain
r02-013-s01-04.png	tax relief for a jacket used
r02-013-s01-05.png	solely in the office .
r02-013-s02-00.png	' If the jacket
r02-013-s02-01.png	is a condition of your employment , '
r02-013-s02-02.png	the Inspector had written , ' it may
r02-013-s02-03.png	qualify for relief . '
r02-038-s00-00.png	' It 's not mine .
r02-038-s01-00.png	I wasn't sitting there . '
r02-038-s02-00.png	She blinked
r02-038-s02-01.png	disdainfully at him and stepped out .
r02-038-s03-00.png	It was a new briefcase , and as the train jogged along
r02-038-s03-01.png	the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil .
r02-038-s04-00.png	He wondered what it contained .
r02-038-s05-00.png	Probably the remains
r02-038-s05-01.png	of someone's lunch or a few secret files .
r02-038-s06-00.png	He smiled at his own joke .
r02-054-s00-00.png	It was locked .
r02-054-s01-00.png	Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
r02-054-s01-01.png	when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
r02-054-s01-02.png	of wads of paper .
r02-054-s02-00.png	' Cor ! ' he muttered aloud , ' there 's
r02-054-s02-01.png	five thousand at least . '
r02-054-s03-00.png	He felt in his jacket pocket
r02-054-s03-01.png	and pulled out a key ring .
r02-054-s04-00.png	In succession he tried
r02-054-s04-01.png	his own briefcase key , a suitcase key and a
r02-054-s04-02.png	device designed to lock typewriters .
r02-060-s00-00.png	Cecil searched in his pockets once
r02-060-s00-01.png	more and came up with two
r02-060-s00-02.png	paper-clips .
r02-060-s01-00.png	After a few seconds
r02-060-s01-01.png	of twisting , he roughly thrust a
r02-060-s01-02.png	bent wire loop into the lock and
r02-060-s01-03.png	waggled it around vigorously .
r02-060-s02-00.png	There was a click and the
r02-060-s02-01.png	briefcase opened .
r02-060-s03-00.png	Cecil thrust an
r02-060-s03-01.png	eager hand inside , his fingers
r02-060-s03-02.png	groping after wads of five
r02-060-s03-03.png	pound notes .
r02-065-s00-00.png	They closed on a single bundle and , fumbling with
r02-065-s00-01.png	nervous excitement , he pulled it out .
r02-065-s01-00.png	His eye
r02-065-s01-01.png	rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
r02-065-s01-02.png	side .
r02-065-s02-00.png	' Old fashioned fivers ! ' he muttered again , and
r02-065-s02-01.png	tried to recall if they were still legal tender .
r02-065-s03-00.png	Surely the
r02-065-s03-01.png	Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never
r02-065-s03-02.png	break their promise to pay on rude demand , let
r02-065-s03-03.png	alone on polite request .
r02-070-s00-00.png	Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon the
r02-070-s00-01.png	printing to find no Govr. , no Compa. , in fact no five pound notes
r02-070-s00-02.png	at all .
r02-070-s01-00.png	He was holding a paper booklet , the top sheet of which
r02-070-s01-01.png	bore , in large Baskerville type , the words METROPOLITAN
r02-070-s01-02.png	MONOTECHNIC INSTITUTE ADVANCED ACCOUNTANCY
r02-070-s01-03.png	COURSE NO. 3 .
r02-070-s02-00.png	He ruffled the sheets irritably and
r02-070-s02-01.png	glowered at his own breach of social morality .
r02-078-s00-00.png	He climbed the stairs , eager to unload the
r02-078-s00-01.png	guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and then
r02-078-s00-02.png	to emerge carrying his shame unseen , but burning ,
r02-078-s00-03.png	into the night .
r02-078-s01-00.png	He reached the barrier and
r02-078-s01-01.png	fumbled for his contract before thrusting the
r02-078-s01-02.png	briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
r02-078-s01-03.png	intention of playing the dutiful citizen
r02-078-s01-04.png	retrieving lost property .
r02-081-s00-00.png	Sentence Database
r02-081-s01-00.png	Before he could open his mouth , the collector
r02-081-s01-01.png	stretched out a hand .
r02-081-s02-00.png	' Watch your step there , sir !
r02-081-s03-00.png	Your briefcase
r02-081-s03-01.png	is hanging open .
r02-081-s04-00.png	You 'll have someone shoving their hot
r02-081-s04-01.png	little hands inside .
r02-081-s05-00.png	Here , I 'll do it . '
r02-081-s06-00.png	The collector pressed the twinkling
r02-081-s06-01.png	catch home with a click .
r02-081-s07-00.png	Cecil , irretrievably laden with
r02-081-s07-01.png	both briefcase and conscience , stumbled away
r02-081-s07-02.png	into the darkness .
r02-089-s00-00.png	' HELLO , CECIL .
r02-089-s01-00.png	HAD a busy day ? '
r02-089-s02-00.png	His mother came into
r02-089-s02-01.png	the hall as he opened the front door .
r02-089-s03-00.png	He nodded irritably
r02-089-s03-01.png	and , turning his back to her , contrived to slide the brief-
r02-089-s03-02.png	case into hiding between the do-it-yourself cupboard
r02-089-s03-03.png	and the polished brass fourteen-pounder shell-case
r02-089-s03-04.png	which served respectively as coat cupboard and um-
r02-089-s03-05.png	brella stand .
r02-089-s04-00.png	' You 're later than usual , aren't you ? '
r02-089-s05-00.png	His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror
r02-089-s05-01.png	they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange
r02-089-s05-02.png	for the labels from half a hundredweight of
r02-089-s05-03.png	Trunk and Greppes Tannin-free Tea .
r02-109-s00-00.png	Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the
r02-109-s00-01.png	inequity of Miss Cheesecake well-nigh bathing
r02-109-s00-02.png	in tax-free champagne whilst he had to go
r02-109-s00-03.png	easy on the immersion heater .
r02-109-s01-00.png	' What is it ,
r02-109-s01-01.png	Cecil ?
r02-109-s02-00.png	Don't you feel well ? ' his mother
r02-109-s02-01.png	asked solicitously .
r02-109-s03-00.png	' You do look tired .
r02-109-s04-00.png	Go and get yourself a drink . '
r02-109-s05-00.png	' Don't
r02-109-s05-01.png	fuss , mother !
r02-109-s06-00.png	I 'm quite well and no more
r02-109-s06-01.png	tired than usual , and we finished the gin
r02-109-s06-02.png	last week , you know that . '
r02-117-s00-00.png	Cecil stepped towards the dining room .
r02-117-s01-00.png	' I 'm
r02-117-s01-01.png	sure you must be tired , ' his mother insisted .
r02-117-s02-00.png	' You 're very irritable , anyway . '
r02-117-s03-00.png	' I 'm NOT tired
r02-117-s03-01.png	and I 'm NOT irritable . '
r02-117-s04-00.png	' Very well then . '
r02-117-s05-00.png	His
r02-117-s05-01.png	mother nodded with understanding .
r02-117-s06-00.png	' You 're not tired .
r02-117-s07-00.png	Nobody 's tired .
r02-117-s08-00.png	Now just you run along
r02-117-s08-01.png	upstairs and wash your hands whilst I get
r02-117-s08-02.png	dinner ready . '
r02-127-s00-00.png	Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management
r02-127-s00-01.png	of a mother who had failed to realise that a son
r02-127-s00-02.png	who is nearly bald is no longer a baby .
r02-127-s01-00.png	He started to
r02-127-s01-01.png	climb the stairs , stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
r02-127-s01-02.png	the treads .
r02-127-s02-00.png	' And don't wipe the dirt off on the
r02-127-s02-01.png	towel like you did yesterday .
r02-131-s00-00.png	Your Auntie Edie 's coming in for a cup of tea later and
r02-131-s00-01.png	you know how she has a good look round everywhere . '
r02-131-s01-00.png	There was
r02-131-s01-01.png	a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard .
r02-131-s02-00.png	Cecil's
r02-131-s02-01.png	mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse
r02-131-s02-02.png	against the brass umbrella stand .
r02-131-s03-00.png	' Well now ! '
r02-131-s04-00.png	She hurried
r02-131-s04-01.png	towards it and picked it up .
r02-137-s00-00.png	' What have we here ?
r02-137-s01-00.png	A new briefcase !
r02-137-s02-00.png	So THAT 'S
r02-137-s02-01.png	what it 's all about . '
r02-137-s03-00.png	Cecil halted in
r02-137-s03-01.png	mid-step near the top of the stairs and
r02-137-s03-02.png	clenched his fists .
r02-137-s04-00.png	' So that 's what
r02-137-s04-01.png	What 's all about ? ' he hissed without
r02-137-s04-02.png	turning round .
r02-137-s05-00.png	She pointed to the
r02-137-s05-01.png	briefcase .
r02-137-s06-00.png	' So that 's why you are so
r02-137-s06-01.png	irritable .
r02-137-s07-00.png	You thought that I 'd think
r02-137-s07-01.png	you 'd been extravagant . '
r02-146-s00-00.png	' But I 'm NOT irritable ! '
r02-146-s01-00.png	He rushed down
r02-146-s01-01.png	the stairs and , snatching the case , ran back
r02-146-s01-02.png	upstairs with it .
r02-146-s02-00.png	' And I 've NOT been
r02-146-s02-01.png	extravagant . '
r02-146-s03-00.png	 Naughty ! ' she called
r02-146-s03-01.png	after him .
r02-146-s04-00.png	' Mother knows her boy .
r02-146-s05-00.png	Arnold Olner
r03-002-s00-00.png	In spite of all the transferred maternity
r03-002-s00-01.png	she was endowed with by her patients ,
r03-002-s00-02.png	poor Serena was an infant-in-arms as
r03-002-s00-03.png	a buyer of property .
r03-002-s01-00.png	No , not even an
r03-002-s01-01.png	infant-in-arms but a new-born babe , a
r03-002-s01-02.png	premature piece of frailty in an oxygen-
r03-002-s01-03.png	tent of utter innocence .
r03-002-s02-00.png	The complexity of
r03-002-s02-01.png	that innocence was colossal .
r03-002-s03-00.png	It had layer
r03-002-s03-01.png	after layer of illusion to be peeled off and
r03-002-s03-02.png	replaced with sad knowledgeability .
r03-007-s00-00.png	It was a nakedness of nai vety to be
r03-007-s00-01.png	clothed leaf by leaf with the disappointment
r03-007-s00-02.png	of experience .
r03-007-s01-00.png	Her first illusion consisted in
r03-007-s01-01.png	the belief that all she need do was to go to
r03-007-s01-02.png	an agent , visit half a dozen houses in one
r03-007-s01-03.png	day , choose one , make an offer , put it in
r03-007-s01-04.png	the hands of a lawyer and go away on her
r03-007-s01-05.png	holiday while the whole transaction was
r03-007-s01-06.png	put through .
r03-026-s00-00.png	Fortunately , however , the fashion for Victorian
r03-026-s00-01.png	architecture which Mr. John Betjeman had
r03-026-s00-02.png	started several decades before had caught on
r03-026-s00-03.png	at last and therefore saved the situation for
r03-026-s00-04.png	the affluent middle-class , who now had plenty
r03-026-s00-05.png	of lovely-ugly to be coldly elegant in .
r03-026-s01-00.png	All this
r03-026-s01-01.png	Serena discovered , and more , but in stages .
r03-026-s02-00.png	For the
r03-026-s02-01.png	first thing she did was to make an offer
r03-026-s02-02.png	on a small pink terraced cottage , two beds ,
r03-026-s02-03.png	two inter-comm. rec. , mod. k. and b. , sep. W.C.
r03-026-s02-04.png	small back yard , newly dec. , near shops and tube
r03-030-s00-00.png	The next thing that Serena discovered was that
r03-030-s00-01.png	she could not afford to buy a house at all .
r03-030-s01-00.png	And this in spite of having at last managed
r03-030-s01-01.png	to save the ten percent needed .
r03-030-s02-00.png	Or so she
r03-030-s02-01.png	thought , being then in possession of what
r03-030-s02-02.png	seemed to her the princely sum of six hund-
r03-030-s02-03.png	red pounds .
r03-030-s03-00.png	The lawyer said :
r03-035-s00-00.png	 Of course you must count about two hundred
r03-035-s00-01.png	for legal charges and stamp duties ,
r03-035-s00-02.png	maybe less , depending on the price of the
r03-035-s00-03.png	house , and whether it has been regis-
r03-035-s00-04.png	tered .
r03-035-s01-00.png	I take it you have a mortgage lined
r03-035-s01-01.png	up , then , Mrs. - er - Buttery ? 
r03-035-s02-00.png	 Not yet ,
r03-035-s02-01.png	but the bank would give me a loan , I 'm
r03-035-s02-02.png	sure . 
r03-035-s03-00.png	 Er , yes .
r03-035-s04-00.png	You have some securities ,
r03-035-s04-01.png	then ? 
r03-050-s00-00.png	His aspect was as dusty as his office , with scurf
r03-050-s00-01.png	from dusty hair on the dusty shoulders of his black
r03-050-s00-02.png	suit , cigarette ash down the front , an ashen face
r03-050-s00-03.png	and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale
r03-050-s00-04.png	grey eyes .
r03-050-s01-00.png	His finger-nails were dirty , though he
r03-050-s01-01.png	tried to make up for it by constantly paring them
r03-050-s01-02.png	with the finger-nail of the opposite hand .
r03-053-s00-00.png	His voice was like his black and pin-stripe ,
r03-053-s00-01.png	a grey superimposition of respectability over
r03-053-s00-02.png	the original colour of his own natural vowels ,
r03-053-s00-03.png	the result being somehow as ineffective , not
r03-053-s00-04.png	just dusty-grey but muddy , slimy even .
r03-053-s01-00.png	His digressions too , seemed to have no other
r03-053-s01-01.png	purpose than the throwing of dust in his
r03-053-s01-02.png	client's eyes , the dust of fake security , of
r03-053-s01-03.png	the fake friend of the family , like the
r03-056-s00-00.png	 Yes , well ... . 
r03-056-s01-00.png	He judged that she had been sufficiently
r03-056-s01-01.png	dazzled and gave a long raucous cough .
r03-056-s02-00.png	 Only
r03-056-s02-01.png	cigarettes worth smoking , these .
r03-056-s03-00.png	Most unhealthy , English
r03-056-s03-01.png	ones .
r03-056-s04-00.png	Well , now , let me see .
r03-056-s05-00.png	I think I can put you onto
r03-056-s05-01.png	some people who might , I say might , let you have a mortgage on
r03-056-s05-02.png	this property ... . 
r03-056-s06-00.png	 But , they 're safe , are they ?
r03-056-s07-00.png	I mean ,
r03-056-s07-01.png	they 're not - money-lenders ? Mrs. - er - Buttery ,
r03-056-s07-02.png	all mortgage companies are money-lenders .
r03-065-s00-00.png	That 's rather the point , isn't it ? 
r03-065-s01-00.png	 No , but I mean - 
r03-065-s02-00.png	 I know what you mean .
r03-065-s03-00.png	You may trust me , Mrs.
r03-065-s03-01.png	Buttery .
r03-065-s04-00.png	I think , however , that you might have
r03-065-s04-01.png	to revise your ideas about - er - the type of
r03-065-s04-02.png	property you intend to purchase . 
r03-065-s05-00.png	She revised
r03-065-s05-01.png	them .
r03-065-s06-00.png	The little man from the Inter-Insular
r03-065-s06-01.png	( British Archipelago ) Insurance Company soon
r03-065-s06-02.png	saw to that .
r03-084-s00-00.png	I 'm afraid we can't take yours into account
r03-084-s00-01.png	at all .
r03-084-s01-00.png	It 's a rule of I.I.I.
r03-084-s02-00.png	You see , you
r03-084-s02-01.png	might stop work to have - well , for all sorts of
r03-084-s02-02.png	reasons , or you might leave him . 
r03-084-s03-00.png	 But how
r03-084-s03-01.png	utterly extraordinary , said Serena angrily ,
r03-084-s03-02.png	 you must be living in the nineteenth century . 
r03-084-s04-00.png	 Oh , but it 's a very general rule , Mrs. Buttery ,
r03-084-s04-01.png	you 'll find that no insurance companies ,
r03-084-s04-02.png	or building societies , for that matter , will
r03-084-s04-03.png	allow for the wife's earnings .
r03-090-s00-00.png	Our lawyers - 
r03-090-s01-00.png	 Who are your lawyers ? 
r03-090-s02-00.png	 Clacton's . 
r03-090-s03-00.png	 Well , I 'm damned . 
r03-090-s04-00.png	 Now , let me see ,
r03-090-s04-01.png	you say your husband earns about ... yes ,
r03-090-s04-02.png	that would come to ... three , carry seven , six
r03-090-s04-03.png	nines are fifty four - of course we 'd have to
r03-090-s04-04.png	have some sort of proof , you know , it 's very
r03-090-s04-05.png	difficult with self-employed persons , carry two .
r03-096-s00-00.png	Yes .
r03-096-s01-00.png	I 'm afraid we couldn't raise this loan to more
r03-096-s01-01.png	than three thousand three fifty at the most .
r03-096-s02-00.png	Now you
r03-096-s02-01.png	could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in
r03-096-s02-02.png	Grimstead for three thousand , that 's where I live , just
r03-096-s02-03.png	before the green belt , lovely and modern , you know .
r03-096-s03-00.png	I forgot to tell you , we don't usually lend any
r03-096-s03-01.png	house built earlier than 1918 . 
r03-110-s00-00.png	 You see , she propounded to Rupert after her last patient
r03-110-s00-01.png	had gone , we can get three thousand three fifty ,
r03-110-s00-02.png	perhaps a little more if we can cheat your earnings
r03-110-s00-03.png	a bit .
r03-110-s01-00.png	I 'm sure you could raise the rest from
r03-110-s01-01.png	one of your publishers , get two books commissioned
r03-110-s01-02.png	and write them later .
r03-110-s02-00.png	I 've got a bit owing too .
r03-110-s03-00.png	Now , I saw some flats in Hendon for four thou ,
r03-110-s03-01.png	and some in West Hampstead for four two fifty ,
r03-110-s03-02.png	two beds , two reception , k. and b. , just think ,
r03-110-s03-03.png	our own bathroom .
r03-115-s00-00.png	Much more spacious than that poky little cottage ,
r03-115-s00-01.png	which wasn't a bit practical really , the
r03-115-s00-02.png	reception room was too small when divided
r03-115-s00-03.png	and too big when not .
r06-000-s00-00.png	Vence is a sober spot , half way between small
r06-000-s00-01.png	town and village , pigeon grey , sly with arches , and
r06-000-s00-02.png	linked by a whispering plot of fountains .
r06-000-s01-00.png	In the main
r06-000-s01-01.png	tree-heavy square you can sit in the autumn
r06-000-s01-02.png	sunshine , still burning like a half-cooled iron ,
r06-000-s01-03.png	sip pastis and read the local newspapers .
r06-003-s00-00.png	One called La Patriote is Communist , and at the time
r06-003-s00-01.png	of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal
r06-003-s00-02.png	tomatoes at General de Gaulle .
r06-003-s01-00.png	One side of this square
r06-003-s01-01.png	is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar .
r06-003-s02-00.png	For one
r06-003-s02-01.png	day , with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative , we had been
r06-003-s02-02.png	hunting for furnished rooms , and had given up , when an
r06-003-s02-03.png	elderly lady , the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest ,
r06-003-s02-04.png	had firmly closed the door in our noses .
r06-007-s00-00.png	' It is a pity , ' said Mart , ' because it would have been
r06-007-s00-01.png	a good address . '
r06-007-s01-00.png	Now , after a woman's radar look ,
r06-007-s01-01.png	she decided Pierre would solve our problems .
r06-007-s02-00.png	This
r06-007-s02-01.png	was true , Pierre was a true Provenc*?6al , thin and
r06-007-s02-02.png	yellow as lemon peel , wrestling with some gnawing rat
r06-007-s02-03.png	of an illness , man of all trades , married to a commanding
r06-007-s02-04.png	lady who loved small talk and the discreet
r06-007-s02-05.png	accumulation of money .
r06-011-s00-00.png	We went in .
r06-011-s01-00.png	There were a few people in the bar ,
r06-011-s01-01.png	elderly , well-off , artistic , who , you felt , had made a hard
r06-011-s01-02.png	bargain for giving up .
r06-011-s02-00.png	' I have furnished rooms , ' said
r06-011-s02-01.png	Pierre , ' and all mod cons . '
r06-011-s03-00.png	The price was 16,000 francs a
r06-011-s03-01.png	month .
r06-011-s04-00.png	' Yes , ' we said immediately , even before viewing .
r06-011-s05-00.png	We were shown around by Pierre .
r06-018-s00-00.png	The flat was on the third floor ; two rooms ; soft Provenc*?
r06-018-s00-01.png	6al view ; good intimate furnishing and colour ; running
r06-018-s00-02.png	hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up ,
r06-018-s00-03.png	basin and bidet ; own private , modern lavatory .
r06-018-s01-00.png	The
r06-018-s01-01.png	first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence .
r06-018-s02-00.png	We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
r06-018-s02-01.png	eruption of turtle-doves .
r06-022-s00-00.png	This was strange , even magic , because the owner's
r06-022-s00-01.png	name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means
r06-022-s00-02.png	' turtledove ' .
r06-022-s01-00.png	Pierre Turtledove .
r06-022-s02-00.png	When we woke up properly it
r06-022-s02-01.png	was raining , an even more hopeless rain than London , and we
r06-022-s02-02.png	looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
r06-022-s02-03.png	curling white breath of the mountains .
r06-022-s03-00.png	The land looked
r06-022-s03-01.png	like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
r06-022-s03-02.png	shame .
r06-027-s00-00.png	There they were , in fact , below us , eight of them .
r06-027-s01-00.png	Four of them were flattened on the window sills , two
r06-027-s01-01.png	immolated on a nearby roof top , the other pair copulating .
r06-027-s02-00.png	We had a morning at Pierre's .
r06-027-s03-00.png	He talked about people .
r06-027-s04-00.png	Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
r06-027-s04-01.png	Lawrence .
r06-027-s05-00.png	He was here , near the railway station , three or
r06-027-s05-01.png	four years .
r06-027-s06-00.png	During this period he wrote a book ,
r06-027-s06-01.png	The Lover of Lady Chatterly .
r06-035-s00-00.png	No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the
r06-035-s00-01.png	reading .
r06-035-s01-00.png	Lawrence died in this very place .
r06-035-s02-00.png	He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
r06-035-s02-01.png	again .
r06-035-s03-00.png	No , he couldn't really remember
r06-035-s03-01.png	him , he was one of the crowd .
r06-035-s04-00.png	The
r06-035-s04-01.png	sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I
r06-035-s04-02.png	sat in the square reading the Patriote .
r06-041-s00-00.png	There was a front-page rear-attack on de
r06-041-s00-01.png	Gaulle , and the rest of the paper was given up
r06-041-s00-02.png	to murders , apart for an outcry against a
r06-041-s00-03.png	proposal to drop radio-active material into
r06-041-s00-04.png	the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
r06-041-s00-05.png	Raphael .
r06-041-s01-00.png	All the murders were well documented
r06-041-s01-01.png	and had the air of being written by an
r06-041-s01-02.png	ingenious , but mad film director of the
r06-041-s01-03.png	Thirties .
r06-044-s00-00.png	They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses .
r06-044-s01-00.png	Monsieur H , for instance , had been clubbed and
r06-044-s01-01.png	throttled to death by his wife , children and
r06-044-s01-02.png	father-in-law , after muddling up some sheep
r06-044-s01-03.png	while the worse for drink .
r06-044-s02-00.png	The family
r06-044-s02-01.png	group then sat down for a late lunch
r06-044-s02-02.png	before the father-in-law telephoned the police .
r06-044-s03-00.png	Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family
r06-044-s03-01.png	troubles , had written to the local
r06-044-s03-02.png	paper and the superintendent of police ,
r06-044-s03-03.png	informing them that he was on the point
r06-049-s00-00.png	Monsieur V's house was immediately
r06-049-s00-01.png	surrounded by firemen and other officials ,
r06-049-s00-02.png	but there was no Monsieur V.
r06-049-s01-00.png	He telephoned
r06-049-s01-01.png	a few minutes later from a nearby village ,
r06-049-s01-02.png	apologising for the trouble , but explaining
r06-049-s01-03.png	that the walls were porous and the
r06-049-s01-04.png	gas had escaped .
r06-049-s02-00.png	General relief was
r06-049-s02-01.png	expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was
r06-049-s02-02.png	actually reported in the next issue ) returned
r06-049-s02-03.png	home and shot himself , leaving a note
r06-049-s02-04.png	which again left his household goods
r06-053-s00-00.png	Some grim comic relief was provided by
r06-053-s00-01.png	an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
r06-053-s00-02.png	who hid himself in a bush and imitated
r06-053-s00-03.png	a blackbird .
r06-053-s01-00.png	Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
r06-053-s01-01.png	was after this very bird and shot the farm-
r06-053-s01-02.png	labourer in the face .
r06-053-s02-00.png	All , however ,
r06-053-s02-01.png	ended well , reported the paper , since the
r06-053-s02-02.png	pellets were easily removed and the
r06-053-s02-03.png	labourer was able to return to work the
r06-053-s02-04.png	same afternoon .
r06-057-s00-00.png	We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta .
r06-057-s01-00.png	You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
r06-057-s01-01.png	way .
r06-057-s02-00.png	In the middle of the journey is a
r06-057-s02-01.png	valley with a sea of vines and olives
r06-057-s02-02.png	and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
r06-057-s02-03.png	the hoe .
r06-057-s03-00.png	Rising from the flecked sea are
r06-057-s03-01.png	islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
r06-057-s03-02.png	towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging
r06-057-s03-03.png	like limpets to the rock .
r06-062-s00-00.png	There is a curd of morning smoke and
r06-062-s00-01.png	a muffled bell taps the sky .
r06-062-s01-00.png	Here we
r06-062-s01-01.png	stopped , as in fine weather we always
r06-062-s01-02.png	stopped .
r06-062-s02-00.png	Down below is the village of
r06-062-s02-01.png	Cagnes , but between are pockets of
r06-062-s02-02.png	heat and cold like the hands of
r06-062-s02-03.png	friends or strangers , and a flurry of
r06-062-s02-04.png	early smells , the dark bosoms of
r06-062-s02-05.png	beech and the thin pine fingers
r06-062-s02-06.png	kissed by the sun .
r06-066-s00-00.png	Then here was Nice , and the old holiday
r06-066-s00-01.png	sea , blue as a new school exercise
r06-066-s00-02.png	book .
r06-066-s01-00.png	The same old Nice , creamy ,
r06-066-s01-01.png	vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with
r06-066-s01-02.png	the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
r06-066-s01-03.png	prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur
r06-066-s01-04.png	to the old sleeping port .
r06-066-s02-00.png	This , and
r06-066-s02-01.png	Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I
r06-066-s02-02.png	could catch the taste of dead dreams on
r06-066-s02-03.png	my tongue like spray .
r06-070-s00-00.png	We parked the Lambretta opposite the
r06-070-s00-01.png	Negresco , and went to the beach to
r06-070-s00-02.png	have a swim .
r06-070-s01-00.png	Amazing bedlam rocked
r06-070-s01-01.png	in our eyes .
r06-070-s02-00.png	The sea boiled with waves ,
r06-070-s02-01.png	they galloped to the walls and spumed
r06-070-s02-02.png	over the Promenade des Anglais .
r06-070-s03-00.png	A huge
r06-070-s03-01.png	crowd had collected .
r06-070-s04-00.png	There were firemen
r06-070-s04-01.png	and policemen and ambulances , and the
r06-070-s04-02.png	eyes of the spectators were hard with
r06-070-s04-03.png	disaster .
r06-076-s00-00.png	They all had that neat look of
r06-076-s00-01.png	Mediterranean people to whom nothing
r06-076-s00-02.png	could ever happen , the chosen sane , the
r06-076-s00-03.png	uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from
r06-076-s00-04.png	disease and accident by doctors , God and
r06-076-s00-05.png	the municipality .
r06-076-s01-00.png	Yet , at any time now ,
r06-076-s01-01.png	the bell would ring for them - the gilded
r06-076-s01-02.png	love house , the mad grandmother or the
r06-076-s01-03.png	bloody child at the crossroads .
r06-090-s00-00.png	It was growing cold .
r06-090-s01-00.png	We left the
r06-090-s01-01.png	crowd and drove back to Vence .
r06-090-s02-00.png	The cool evening perfumes stood
r06-090-s02-01.png	beckoning at the corners of the roads .
r06-090-s03-00.png	Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
r06-090-s03-01.png	organs were impaired years ago ) , and
r06-090-s03-02.png	I had to explain the low , sharp and
r06-090-s03-03.png	sweet signals in the air .
r06-090-s04-00.png	When we
r06-090-s04-01.png	got back home we felt exhausted .
r06-090-s05-00.png	London sickness ( a sense of guilt ,
r06-090-s05-01.png	mingled with the memory of sandwiches
r06-097-s00-00.png	We went straight to bed and slept until
r06-097-s00-01.png	the turtle-doves drummed up the
r06-097-s00-02.png	sun .
r06-097-s01-00.png	The next morning , in the square
r06-097-s01-01.png	opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice
r06-097-s01-02.png	beach catastrophe in the Patriote .
r06-097-s02-00.png	Mart had been right , the body had been
r06-097-s02-01.png	a woman's .
r06-097-s03-00.png	It belonged to a Madame
r06-097-s03-01.png	N.
r06-097-s04-00.png	Enquiries had been made in the
r06-097-s04-01.png	neighbourhood , and it transpired that
r06-097-s04-02.png	Madame N's husband had made an
r06-097-s04-03.png	arrangement with the dead lady's sister
r06-103-s00-00.png	The sister , able to swim , had returned
r06-103-s00-01.png	to the shore , but instead of returning
r06-103-s00-02.png	to her brother-in-law ( with whom
r06-103-s00-03.png	she had an illicit relationship ) , she
r06-103-s00-04.png	went to her fiance*?2's house and
r06-103-s00-05.png	confessed everything .
r06-103-s01-00.png	Her fiance*?2
r06-103-s01-01.png	reported her to the police , and then jumped
r06-103-s01-02.png	off a cliff near Monte Carlo .
r06-106-s00-00.png	The day I promised to take Catherine
r06-106-s00-01.png	down to visit my young friend Philip
r06-106-s00-02.png	at his school in the country , we were
r06-106-s00-03.png	to leave at eleven , but she arrived
r06-106-s00-04.png	at nine .
r06-106-s01-00.png	Her blue dress was new ,
r06-106-s01-01.png	and so were her fashionable shoes .
r06-106-s02-00.png	Her
r06-106-s02-01.png	hair had just been done .
r06-106-s03-00.png	She looked
r06-106-s03-01.png	more than ever like a pink and gold
r06-106-s03-02.png	Renoir girl who expects everything from
r06-106-s03-03.png	life .
r06-111-s00-00.png	Catherine lives in a white house
r06-111-s00-01.png	overlooking the sweeping brown tides
r06-111-s00-02.png	of the river .
r06-111-s01-00.png	She helped me clean up my
r06-111-s01-01.png	flat with a devotion which said that
r06-111-s01-02.png	she felt small flats were altogether more
r06-111-s01-03.png	romantic than large houses .
r06-111-s02-00.png	We drank
r06-111-s02-01.png	tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,
r06-111-s02-02.png	being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every-
r06-111-s02-03.png	thing from food to music .
r06-115-s00-00.png	Catherine looked at the books lying
r06-115-s00-01.png	around his room , and asked if she
r06-115-s00-02.png	might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
r06-115-s00-03.png	to read on the train .
r06-115-s01-00.png	Catherine is 13 .
r06-115-s02-00.png	I suggested she might find them dif-
r06-115-s02-01.png	ficult , but she said ,
r06-115-s03-00.png	' Philip reads them ,
r06-115-s03-01.png	doesn't he ? '
r06-115-s04-00.png	During the journey I read
r06-115-s04-01.png	newspapers and watched her pretty
r06-115-s04-02.png	frowning face as she turned the
r06-115-s04-03.png	pages of Babel , for she was determined
r06-115-s04-04.png	to let nothing get between her and
r06-121-s00-00.png	At the school , which is charming , ci-
r06-121-s00-01.png	vilised and expensive , the two children
r06-121-s00-02.png	walked together across green fields , and
r06-121-s00-03.png	I followed , seeing how the sun gilded
r06-121-s00-04.png	their bright friendly heads turned
r06-121-s00-05.png	towards each other as they talked .
r06-121-s01-00.png	In
r06-121-s01-01.png	Catherine's left hand she carried the
r06-121-s01-02.png	stories of Isaac Babel .
r06-121-s02-00.png	After lunch we
r06-121-s02-01.png	went to the pictures .
r06-121-s03-00.png	Philip allowed
r06-121-s03-01.png	# it to be seen that he thought going to
r06-121-s03-02.png	the pictures just for the fun of it was
r06-126-s00-00.png	For his sake we chose the more
r06-126-s00-01.png	serious of the two films that were
r06-126-s00-02.png	showing in the little town .
r06-126-s01-00.png	It was
r06-126-s01-01.png	about a good priest who helped cri-
r06-126-s01-02.png	minals in New York .
r06-126-s02-00.png	His goodness , how-
r06-126-s02-01.png	ever , was not enough to prevent one
r06-126-s02-02.png	of them from being sent to the gas
r06-126-s02-03.png	chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
r06-126-s02-04.png	Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
r06-126-s02-05.png	crying and could face the light of a golden
r06-126-s02-06.png	evening .
r06-130-s00-00.png	At the entrance of the cinema the
r06-130-s00-01.png	doorman was lying in wait for anyone
r06-130-s00-02.png	who had red eyes .
r06-130-s01-00.png	Grasping Catherine
r06-130-s01-01.png	by her suffering arm , he said bitterly :
r06-130-s02-00.png	' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be
r06-130-s02-01.png	punished for his crime , didn't he ? '
r06-130-s03-00.png	Cathe-
r06-130-s03-01.png	rine stared at him , incredulous .
r06-130-s04-00.png	Philip
r06-130-s04-01.png	rescued her by saying with disdain :
r06-130-s05-00.png	' Some people don't know right from wrong
r06-130-s05-01.png	even when its demonstrated to them . '
r06-137-s00-00.png	The doorman turned his attention
r06-137-s00-01.png	to the next red-eyed emerger from the
r06-137-s00-02.png	dark ; and we went on together to
r06-137-s00-03.png	the station , the children silent because
r06-137-s00-04.png	of the cruelty of the world .
r06-137-s01-00.png	Finally Catherine
r06-137-s01-01.png	said , her eyes wet again :
r06-137-s02-00.png	' I think its all
r06-137-s02-01.png	absolutely beastly , and I can't bear to think
r06-137-s02-02.png	about it . '
r06-137-s03-00.png	And Philip said :
r06-137-s04-00.png	' But we 've got
r06-137-s04-01.png	to think about it , don't you see , because
r06-137-s04-02.png	if we don't it 'll just go on and on , don't
r06-137-s04-03.png	you see ? '
r06-143-s00-00.png	In the train going back to London I sat
r06-143-s00-01.png	beside # Catherine .
r06-143-s01-00.png	She had the stories open
r06-143-s01-01.png	in front of her , but she said :
r06-143-s02-00.png	' Philip 's awfully lucky .
r06-143-s03-00.png	I wish I went to that school .
r06-143-s04-00.png	Did you notice
r06-143-s04-01.png	that girl who said hullo to him in the garden ?
